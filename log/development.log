The most forgotten of its forgotten wars. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>It was one act in a three-act tragedy that, from Bosnia to Kosovo, and from Libya and Syria, unfolded according to the same invariable scenario.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>And it was a non-subject for scholars, a no man's land for knowledge. It was, in fact, little more than a name -- \"the Bangladesh war,\" as exotic as it was distant -- that was in the process of being erased from the collective memory of the West.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Until the arrival of a memorable book by Princeton University professor Gary Bass. <i>The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide</i> (Knopf) returns to this story and, while doing justice to the war's victims, also, for the first time, draws out for us its lessons. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>We discover right off the bat that genocide (the war in Bangladesh was indeed an attempt at genocide) could occur so soon after Auschwitz without capturing the attention of the world at large or even, with rare exceptions such as André Malraux, any of its prominent individual consciences. That fact became overwhelmingly evident in Bangladesh.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>We witness the origins of the terms of a debate that has continued, practically unaltered, for 40 years: intervention or noninterference? Humanity: singular or plural? Is there an established natural right -- is there an international law -- that can be cited against a dictator who slaughters his own people, or do rights and laws exist only within the borders of nations, and too bad about those who have the misfortune to have been born in Jessore or Dacca? Does the idea of a universal conscience and, related to it, an international community, have any meaning, or must we settle for Goebbels's sadly famous theorem that a man's home is his castle? </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Bass shows us how small causes (Kissinger's liking for the Pakistani dictator, Yahya Khan, a drunken brute) can have large and horrifying effects: a terrible war that lasted nearly a year and exacted a death toll still unknown (300,000? 500,000? A million or more?), but which, as Bass shows, followed the same pattern as the ongoing war in Syria, where the escalation to extremes can be explained, at least in part, by the manner in which Vladimir Putin has poured in weapons and advisers. The Bangladesh war lasted as long as it did only because the Putin of that era, a man by the name of Richard Nixon, was stubbornly persistent in his support of someone whom he saw as an Asian reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>The book also shows, conversely, how lone individuals can stand in the way of the killing machine and, after a long, agonizingly long period of crying out in the wilderness, finish by being heard. In this case, that individual was not a war reporter running the blockade on pictures from the front; nor was it an intellectual forcing the world, in the manner later adopted in the United States by the late and much-lamented Christopher Hitchens, to see that which it would prefer not to see -- no, in this case, the individuals in question were a handful of \"petty\" diplomats, such as the American consul general in Dacca, the aptly named Archer Blood, who, after dozens of cables warning the administration of the responsibility it was incurring through its support of the bloodbath, joined 19 of his colleagues in making public a \"blood telegram\" that cut short his career but pricked the world's conscience and led to India's intervention. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>And finally Bass shows us how a strong political will -- at the time, that of Indira Gandhi -- can, when it is harnessed to morality and law, put an end to temporizing. Except for the cast, it's the same movie that we watched 20 years later in Bosnia and 40 years later in Libya and Mali. Without succumbing to otherworldliness or to the idealization of an Indian prime minister who had her dark side (and how!), the book is also a tribute to politics in its true sense, to a politics that is not afraid to turn history away from subservience to the supposedly inexorable facts, or, better, to stage a coup against history.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Many readers will not be aware of my deep attachment to beautiful Bangladesh, whose war of liberation I covered more than 40 years ago for the newspaper <i>Combat</i> (founded by Albert Camus), where I met and mixed with the nation's liberator, Mujibur Rahman (father of the current, courageous prime minister), and of which I chronicled the tragic and noble birth in my very first book, <i>Les Indes rouges</i>. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>But I do want readers to be aware of the appearance of Gary Bass' book, which I hope will be widely read (and translated into French!) because it places a spotlight on one of the most terribly neglected corners of the world. (The cities of the Ganges delta are so poor and powerless that, like Nineveh, Canopus, Heraklion and Meroë, they live under the constant threat of being swallowed up by supposedly natural catastrophes that the world now has all of the necessary technical means to prevent should it choose to do so.) And because it tells a modern story that we have seen repeated so many times: To understand the recurrent cowardice of the West, its blindness, and the sonorous vacuum that envelopes even the theory of the international community today, a return to Bangladesh is required reading. </p><br />\n<br />\n<em><p>Translated by Steven B.

Cuarón said of the young actor, \"I am so full of admiration on how he's handling his career. I'm so filled with admiration for him. He's so smart and has amazing taste.\" And then he added, \"I would love to do something with him again. I'm a big fan, man. In your article you can quote me, because he's one actor I would love to work with again.\" <br />\n<br />\nAs it happened, the next interview on this reporter's slate was Radcliffe, who is now promoting the Sundance Film Festival favorite \"Kill Your Darlings\" (due in theaters on Oct. 16). We let Radcliffe read the nice words his former \"Harry Potter\" director said about him. Below is Radcliffe's response to Cuarón -- and his opinion of how Cuarón completely changed the course of the Harry Potter franchise.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Radcliffe:</strong> [Reading] \"Send my love to the bastard\" [laughs]. \"Send my love to the <i>amazing</i> bastard.\"<br />\n<br />\n<strong>He went on record that he wants to do another movie with you. I think people would like that.</strong><br />\nWell, that's awesome. I would love to. He's such a fine director and I <i>really</i> want to see \"Gravity.\" <br />\n<br />\n<strong>It's great.</strong><br />\nIt also just looks <i>terrifying</i>. It looks like the kind of thing that I personally have nightmares about. Have you ever read \"The Martian Chronicles\" by Ray Bradbury? He wrote a story in \"The Martian Chronicles\" where you just get launched into space -- and that terrifies me. So the trailer for \"Gravity\" scares the shit out of me already. He's a pretty stunning filmmaker.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Now, looking back, just how different was it going from Chris Columbus for the first two movies to Cuarón for \"Prisoner of Azkaban\"?</strong><br />\nI mean, it was. It was <i>very</i> different. But it was also like, I think it's the best decision that was ever made for the series. Because it just changed how people saw us and it changed the perception of what we were trying to do. \"Oh, they're trying to make something different!\" He had just come off \"Y Tu Mamá También,\" so that was people's frame of reference for Alfonso.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Or, back then, for a lot of people who don't pay close attention to movies, \"Who?\"</strong><br />\nYeah, absolutely. But I think it's just what he did with the film was so extraordinary, and it's <i>still</i> many people's favorite of all of the Potters. I think he did wonders for the series and all of us. That was the film where I was suddenly of an age for the first time where I was able to <i>be directed</i> by him -- more than I had been capable of being in the past. And, also, I was suddenly, working with Gary Oldman and David Thewlis and whereas all the older actors in the first two movies had known me as a kid, they hadn't. They only know me as a 14-year-old, so they treat me as a young man rather than a boy. And I think that whole film is a huge turning point -- it's really where I decided that I wanted to be and absolutely continue to be an actor.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

Your options for your homepage design are vast, but having strong and inviting homepage text can sometimes be enough to keep readers browsing your site. <br />\n<br />\nOne strategy we’ve found to be effective in keeping your audience interested is to write a letter for your homepage. Simply put, your Dear Visitor letter can be a blurb that talks about your writing and yourself as a writer—essentially, a welcome letter. Think about what you want to know about an author when you visit his/her website, and then answer some of those questions about yourself. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>What To Ask Yourself Before Writing Your Dear Visitor Letter</strong><br />\nWhat are some of your interests aside from writing? Is there anything new and exciting going on in your life right now? Do you have an email list or any social media platforms where your readers can follow you? What are some of the themes of your work? Do you ever host contests or giveaways as incentives for your readership? Do you have a link to your most recent publication? What do you see for yourself in the future? What are you currently penning?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Assembling Your Dear Visitor Letter</strong><br />\nAfter you’ve answered some or all of those questions, it’s time to put the letter together. Of course, there’s a format for that! As always, you’ll want to begin with a salutation (a “Dear Visitor” would be fitting!). <br />\n<br />\nThen, you’ll want to welcome your readers to kick off their shoes and stick around awhile, in your own unique way. Next, include the answers to the questions above. In your last paragraphs, you’ll want to lead your readers in a specific direction (ask them to visit another part of the site, sign up for your mailing list, follow you on Twitter, etc.). <br />\n<br />\nAnd, finally, your signature! You can choose to type your name or use a graphic image of your signature (be careful using your full name—identity theft is a huge problem these days!). You should save the image file with your name as the file name (for example, John_Smith.jpg) with the alternate text and description including your name as well. This will ensure that Google will associate the image with your name. <br />\n<br />\nWe all know there’s nothing worse than a bunch of typos on a writer’s website, so be sure to have your Dear Visitor letter looked over by a professional proofreader before you post it to your homepage.

I looked into the unfamiliar titles and read three. <em>Janey and Me: Growing Up with My Mother</em> by Virginia Ironside was a revelation, an extremely well written and revealing family portrait by the journalist author about her mother who rose to become Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art despite not being an academic.<br />\n<br />\nMore curious was Pete's assessment of Ozzy Osbourne's <em>I Am Ozzy</em> as rock's best memoir. I would not have pegged Pete as an Ozzy fan, and surprised that he would have even cracked it open. It was delightful, a showcase for Ozzy's natural humor and a memory much more intact than the addled state he displayed on <em>The Osbourne's.</em><br />\n<br />\nI wasn't a fan of Ozzy's original band, Black Sabbath, but I did see them play live, twice. The first time, in November 1971 at the Long Beach Arena, it was as though Ozzy was in an alternate universe. The band was playing grinding, serious music, and here was Ozzy delightfully grinning as though he had disembarked from a ride at Disneyland. Ozzy, his shirt off, good-naturedly waved his arms as he sang songs titled \"Wicked World,\" \"Children of the Grave,\" \"War Pigs\" and \"Paranoid.\" He configured his hands into V-sign peace symbols, and gestured just like President Nixon. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I interviewed Ozzy months later at a house in Bel-Air the band was renting, for an article that ran in the UCLA <em>Daily Bruin</em>, he explained that the band's music had a positive, cathartic affect on their fans. Seeing the band in concert, they were able to relieve their frustrations. I hadn't thought that a band with a gloomy outlook, with references to Lucifer, nightmares, witchcraft and the supernatural, could make listeners overtly happy. I was surprised when Ozzy named the upbeat Beatles his favorite musical artist. (Truth be told, bassist Geezer Butler supplied most of the horror-laden lyrics.) On top of it all, Ozzy was a willing and engaging conversationalist. He invited me to the band's recording session that evening.<br />\n<br />\nLittle did I suspect that the company Richard Foos and I started, the Rhino Records label, would be issuing Black Sabbath records three decades later. But it almost didn't happen. Sharon Osbourne was now representing the financial interests of not only her husband but the other members of the band. It was almost comical. It was as if she and Ozzy were lounging on the sofa, snickering, watching <em>Austin Powers.</em> Taking a cue from Dr. Evil, they concocted a demand for \"one million dollars!\"\t\t<br />\n<br />\nIt was outrageous because we weren't getting anything new.  In the U.S., Black Sabbath recorded for Warner Brothers Records. They were paid an advance on their royalties for each album they recorded, and then subsequent royalties as their advances were recouped from sales on the albums. Rhino didn't want to have Black Sabbath record anything new, merely to do a great job on reissuing the catalogue, initially with a box set of the original lineup's first eight albums. In re-signing with Warner's in the seventies, the band's representative inserted a clause that gave the group approval of any new configuration of the recordings, and Sharon was hitting up Rhino on behalf of her client or they wouldn't approve. It was a pure money grab. There was little consideration for the fine work that Rhino normally does, or the desire to create quality product. There was a stalemate for a couple of years, but Sharon got her advance. In the composition of any book, the writer has to determine what to leave it and what to take out. There's more to the Black Sabbath story, but as the reissues didn't come out until Richard and I had left the company, I didn't think it appropriate to include in the book.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Harold Bronson's book THE RHINO RECORDS STORY will be published on October 22nd.</em>", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 08:27:54 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-bronson/the-rhino-records-story-t_1_b_4025753.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-bronson/the-rhino-records-story-t_1_b_4025753.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 12:27:54 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Rhino Records Story Takes Shape Part 3: Sharon Osbourne Says 'One Million Dollars!'"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

(AP) — The captain of the American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates four years ago returned home from sea to another hero's welcome — this time for a sneak peek of the Tom Hanks movie about the ordeal.<br />\n<br />\n\"Captain Phillips\" got an early screening Tuesday night at a benefit in Richard Phillips' home state of Vermont ahead of its national release in theaters on Oct. 11. Phillips got a rousing standing ovation after he addressed the packed theater. He said the movie was entertainment but the benefit showing was an opportunity to raise money for a Champlain College scholarship in honor of a 2012 graduate who died. The event also gave him a chance to honor the military and say thanks to his crew and Vermont community, who he said helped him and his family in a time of need.<br />\n<br />\n\"The military — they are the true heroes in my story,\" said Phillips, who was introduced by former Gov. Jim Douglas.<br />\n<br />\nHanks plays Phillips in Paul Greengrass' docudrama adapted from the captain's memoir about the April 2009 hijacking. The actor kept Phillips' beard and eyeglasses in the movie, but he didn't speak with the merchant ship captain's strong New England accent.<br />\n<br />\nPhillips spent five days as a hostage of Somali pirates on a lifeboat after the Maersk Alabama was hijacked. He was beaten, tied up and threatened before he was rescued days later by U.S. Navy SEALs, who shot three of the pirates.<br />\n<br />\nBefore the screening, he said he never felt empathy for the Somali pirates.<br />\n<br />\n\"That never entered my mind,\" Phillips said in an interview. \"We were always adversaries. I thought it was important to make sure we both knew we were adversaries in that. I thought that was important for me and my survival. There was no Stockholm syndrome.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe sneak peak in Williston was a benefit for a fund created in honor of Sarah Elizabeth Ramsey, who died in June after being struck by a car in New York City. Ramsey had dated Phillips' nephew.<br />\n<br />\nThe fund was established by Ramsey's friends and family for third- and fourth-year marketing students who want to expand their professional and international experiences. The scholarship will be awarded each year. Ramsey spent a semester in Lima, Peru, during her junior year and completed an eight-week advertising internship in Shanghai, China, before graduating.<br />\n<br />\n\"Captain Phillips\" is expected to be a major contender during Hollywood's awards season.

In total, Schulz's work, formerly known as \"Lil' Folks,\" reached 75 countries in 2,600 different papers and was published in an impressive 21 languages every day. Perhaps Syracuse University professor Robert Thompson put it best when he famously described \"Peanuts\" as \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/arts/charles-m-schulz-peanuts-creator-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm\" target=\"_hplink\">arguably the longest story ever told by one human being</a>.\"<br />\n<br />\nGenerations of Americans and comic enthusiasts around the globe continue to cherish \"Peanuts,\" whether it's through holiday television productions, theatrical works or even amusement parks.

Did I mention that I'm superstitious and I believe in ghosts? However, I do enjoy researching and writing about them--the creepier the better. I even braved standing outside of Lilburn Mansion, one of the real haunted locations in \"Unbreakable,\" to film a video about the book (which <a href=\"http://www.kamigarcia.com/the-unbreakable-book-trailer-is-here/\" target=\"_hplink\">you can watch here</a>).

Tours are available, but violent deaths in the solitary confinement area and the boiler room have resulted in too much poltergeist activity for my taste.   <br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"waverly sanatorium\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1383353/thumbs/o-WAVERLY-SANATORIUM-570.jpg?6\" /><br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Waverly Sanatorium in Louisville, Kentucky: </strong>This hospital opened in 1910 to treat tuberculosis patients. But experimental procedures and tuberculosis itself lead to insanity or death for 6,000 patients during the 52 years Waverly Hills was open. The paranormal activity includes: a little girl on the third floor who plays hide and seek with visitors and an old woman with bloody wrists screaming for help. Still, there are plans to turn this historic building into a hotel (which you can bet I won't be staying at any time soon).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Bell Witch Farm in Adams, Tennessee:</strong> An unseen force terrorized the Bell family with everything from rat and insect infestation to physical torment. The entity claimed to be the spirit of Kate Batts, a neighbor who was cheated by John Bell. Her goals were simple: kill John Bell and stop his daughter Betsy from marrying a neighbor boy - both of which she achieved. If you've brave enough, you can take a tour of the Bell Witch Cave and a reproduction of the Bells' cabin. The original home was torn down for safety purposes (not a great indicator of a choice vacation spot).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Devil's Road in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania:</strong> Street signs were removed, which makes it difficult to locate this windy road just north of the Delaware border. The abundance of \"No Trespassing\" notices discourages exploring if you find it. So why is the Devil's Road so creepy? Follow it long enough and you'll see the infamous Cult House, which has plenty of disturbing rumors surrounding it. The trees lining the road all lean steeply away from the road - and the house.

The ghosts are said to include a woman whose screams have led the Philadelphia police to investigate (only to find no one there), a faceless man, a tour guide in Revolutionary clothing, and plenty of children and dogs. Fort Mifflin is worth checking out for its historical significance, but if you have a run-in with the faceless man, don't say I didn't warn you.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"stull cemetery\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1383342/thumbs/o-STULL-CEMETERY-570.jpg?3\" /><br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Stull Cemetery in Stull, Kansas:</strong> For a tiny town near Topeka, Stull has had more than its share of paranormal action.

The boy and his family stayed in this St. Louis house after the word \"Louis\" appeared above his ribs.

He had been talking for several years about his desire to write the 'spy novel to end all spy novels'. But his attention had simply drifted in other directions. <br />\n<br />\nAfter hostilities ended, he had been recruited as Foreign Manager of another London-based newspaper, <em>the Sunday Times</em>, a job that required him to build up a network of foreign correspondents, not so different from the agents with whom he liaised when he was the influential war-time Personal Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral John Godfrey.<br />\n<br />\nIn that earlier job, he had been Godfrey's gate-keeper in Room 39 of the Admiralty. He dealt directly with MI6 and the other secret services on behalf of his boss. He saw agents going to and returning from the field. He played a major role in liaising on intelligence matters with President Roosevelt's special enjoy, Colonel \"Wild\" Bill Donovan, whom he visited in Washington in the summer of 1941 and helped draw up guidelines for the combined US intelligence agency which would later become the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and then the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). One of his memos detailing the ideal American agent seems in retrospect to anticipate the qualities of James Bond. Donovan later presented him with a .38 Colt Police Positive revolver inscribed \"For Special Services.\"<br />\n<br />\nFleming was essentially a bureaucrat during the war. But, being an imaginative man (he had written poetry in his youth), he could not help thinking about a more active role as a secret agent. <br />\n<br />\nBefore James Bond could make his first appearance at Royale Les Eaux in Casino Royale, however, Fleming had to get his own life in order. <br />\n<br />\nWith his considerable chutzpah, he negotiated a fantastic deal with his new employer, Kemsley Newspapers (which owned <em>the Sunday Times</em>), which meant he was paid £5000 a year and able to take off three months of the year.<br />\n<br />\nThis was just what he wanted because the other main post-war ambition was to build himself a house in Jamaica. This came about after he had fallen in love with the Caribbean island during an Anglo-American naval conference there in 1942. He vowed he would come back there to live. So one of his first initiatives in late 1945 was to buy himself some land on the north coast of Jamaica, near Oracabessa. <br />\n<br />\nThere, he built a basic bungalow which he called Goldeneye, after a secret war-time intelligence operation he had run (involving contingency plans if Hitler had moved into the Iberian peninsula). One of his first guests was the entertainer Noel Coward who was scornful of the facilities and referred to his stay at \"Golden eye, nose and throat\" (clinic was implied).<br />\n <br />\nBut Fleming loved snorkelling and exploring the sea round his house. And he entertained many friends, eager to flee the British winter and post-war austerity. <br />\n<br />\nAmong his visitors was Ann, Lady Rothermere, who had told her husband that she was visiting her friend Noel Coward who had his own house, Blue Harbour, three miles from Goldeneye. She bore Fleming a still-born daughter, and then when she became pregnant by him again, she obtained a divorce and came out to Jamaica to marry her lover.<br />\n<br />\nThis was not exactly on Fleming's commitment-averse agenda. It also brought other factors into play. While in London, Ann had surrounded herself with writers and artists at her then marital home, Warwick House. She was a friend of Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, Patrick Leigh Fermor and others. Fleming felt that a book might be a useful entrée into this circle. <br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, his own elder brother Peter had forged a successful career as a writer, and, only the previous summer, he had published his own spoof espionage novel, The Sixth Column. <br />\n<br />\nDriven by a desire to impress his wife and by fraternal competitiveness, Ian settled down in Goldeneye to write \"Casino Royale.\" The fictional venue in Northern France and the gambling ambience reflected his pre-war days as a playboy bachelor. The escapist story line and the suggestion of a better life gave hope to Britons just beginning to experience modern consumerism. The plot drew on his close liaison with the intelligence services. The theme of betrayal, epitomized by Vesper Lynd's treatment of Bond, tallied with emerging information (to which Fleming was privy) about the disappearance of British diplomats, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, who were suspected of being Soviet spies. And the hero of the novel was James Bond, Fleming's alter ego, the action man he would have so loved to have been. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.andrewlycett.co.uk/\" target=\"_hplink\">Andrew Lycett's</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ian-Fleming-Andrew-Lycett/dp/1250037980\" target=\"_hplink\">\"Ian Fleming\" is published by St Martin's Press [$29.99]</a>.

And in Vietnam, they surely would have seconded the words of David Douglas Duncan, a Marine photographer during World War II in the Pacific, the great photographer in Korea (for Life magazine), and present with a camera in the ferocious battle for Khe Sanh in 1968. He said about his Korean photographs: “I wanted to show what war did to a man... I wanted to tell a story of war, as war has always been for men through the ages. Only their weapons, the terrain, the causes have changed.”<br />\n<br />\nThe AP photographers in Vietnam—as this book shows—wanted to do the same, as did such others as Tim Page, Larry Burrows, and Kyoichi Sawada, who worked alongside them. But they carried out their task beyond the earlier visions of Capa and Duncan. Each, in different ways, was showing what war did to all human beings. Not simply to the warriors, but to the civilians. In Vietnam, it was often impossible to separate them. Day after day, hour after hour, the photographers reminded us that these civilians were more than mere statistics. They were human beings.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"vietnam photo 1\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1384021/thumbs/o-VIETNAM-PHOTO-1-570.jpg?1\" /><br />\n<br />\nMany photographers moved in and out of the AP bureau during the Vietnam War. Some were freelancers, offering their film for a price (in Browne’s day it was $5 a photo). But those on staff were among the best who ever practiced their dangerous craft. Consider, for purposes of compression, only these names: Horst Faas, Eddie Adams, Henri Huet, Nick Ut, Dang Van Phuoc.<br />\n<br />\nFaas was a burly man, born in Berlin in 1933, the same year that Adolf Hitler came to power. When he was nine, he was compelled, like all other German kids his age, to join Hitler Youth. Later, he remembered the war for his constant hunger, and for the oddly beautiful sight of American bombers in the sky, and tracer bullets trying to destroy them. At war’s end, his parents took him and the other Faas children out of the devastation of Berlin, fearful of the arrival of the Red Army, and they made their way to the West. His education was eclectic (it included eight years of Latin and a course in journalism that stopped at Gutenberg), but at eighteen he found a job as a clerk for the Keystone photo agency in Munich. His job: helping to comb through a roomful of several million photographs, organizing them into files. He first learned about photographs by studying them. Within a few years, he was carrying a camera and making them. By 1951, he was covering major stories in Europe, including the 1954 peace conference in Geneva about a place on the other side of the globe: Indochina. Just before Christmas, 1955, he was hired by the AP. He was soon in Bonn, the capital of West Germany. He was the AP’s only photographer in that city, with competition from UPI and the German press. He had no guidance. Just assignments from Frankfurt or New York.<br />\n<br />\n“I didn’t know what I was doing,” he remembered years later, “and I had to follow my peers from the opposition to see what and how we worked there.” <br />\n<br />\nAt the AP he was handed a Speed Graphic, a camera that he hated for its clumsiness and the way focusing sometimes robbed him of that “decisive moment.” But it was the AP. And the AP was driven with urgency.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"vietnam photo 2\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1384025/thumbs/o-VIETNAM-PHOTO-2-570.jpg?1\" /><br />\n<br />\n“Working for AP,” he remembered, “it was always that you worked in fear. Fear of the events that have not happened yet... And it invariably happened at three in the morning.”<br />\n<br />\nAfter five years in Bonn, the AP sent him to his first war: in the Belgian Congo. He had volunteered for the assignment. He thought he would be in the Congo for a few weeks, and parked his car at the airport. He would be gone for a year and a half. But he didn’t mind. At last he had a chance to make good pictures in a truly bad place. Out there, in the great wide world, with a Leica he had paid for himself. First stop: Leopoldville.<br />\n<br />\n“It was my chance to get into international journalism,” he said later, “and I used it and jumped and never came back.”<br />\nIn the Congo, tribal forces, regular Congolese army troops, and United Nations peacekeepers were fighting one another in a country of rivers, swamps, and jungle. Faas met other correspondents, including a small group from Fleet Street, and a young man from the New York Times named David Halberstam, who was then twenty-seven, passionate and intense about his craft. They were present together at some of the battles in the three-way combat in Katanga. Other times Faas went alone into fierce combat and, when he returned to Leopoldville, would brief Halberstam (and some other reporters). Sometimes Halberstam introduced Faas to people the German could not easily meet, including U.S. Embassy analysts and CIA spooks. Horst and David became friends for life.<br />\n<br />\n“Yeah, he was a friendly American,” Faas later said, “as authoritative as he always was. He always taught us to be serious journalists, dress seriously and act seriously, and responsibly... Not play around with the world of news.”<br />\n<br />\nAfter a year and a half, a worn-out Faas told his AP bosses that he wanted to go skiing. He had seen enough victims of assassinations, torture, and treachery in the exhausting heat of the Congo. They agreed that he could leave and thanked him for a job well done. He went skiing in Tours. A few days later, he was called by the AP in Paris and told to go to Algeria. Another war, marked by assassinations, torture, and treachery, was under way in an outpost of the eroding French Empire. Faas went. The war was almost impossible to cover, and very dangerous, particularly for reporters and photographers. Many of them had been marked for killing. The killers might have pledged allegiance to Algerian nationalism, to continued French sovereignty, to Islam, to simple vengeance for old injuries. The cause didn’t matter. The effect was death. Not simply in Algeria, but increasingly from the right-wing OAS, in the heart of Paris. Faas did his best for ten weeks, and then got another call from the AP bosses. Now they wanted him to go to Laos. In Indochina.<br />\n<br />\nIn Laos, he met Peter Arnett and confronted another baffling, three-sided local struggle, with Americans from the virtually faceless CIA controlling all access to the action. Or actively preventing that access. And then Arnett and Faas were told to move on to Saigon. To help cover the Buddhist crisis. That destination, and the work they performed there for the AP, would define the lives of both men.<br />\n<br />\n<em>© 2013 Deidre Enterprises, Inc.</em><br />\n<br />\n<HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--319345--HH>", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 07:51:07 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/vietnam-photo-book_n_4025836.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/vietnam-photo-book_n_4025836.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 11:51:07 UTC +00:00], ["title", "New Book Collects Most Startling Photos From The Vietnam War"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

He'd been looking forward to an afternoon at home on the kibbutz when the call came. It was Hannah Ginsberg at the kibbutz's spa, a quarter mile away by the turgid, gunmetal waters of the Dead Sea. The computer had crashed -- again.<br />\n<br />\n\"So? Reboot,\" said Dov.<br />\n<br />\n\"I did. Still doesn't work.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"What about Schmuel?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"In Beersheba.\"<br />\n<br />\nSon of a bitch. The entire spa paralyzed because of a Paleolithic computer and a klutzy manager. So here he was: Dov Ben-David, the former deputy director of Israel's feared Mossad, the man responsible for liquidating anyone who posed a mortal threat to the Jewish State -- from Palestinian terrorists to Iranian nuclear scientists -- here he was, turning his day upside down to deal with a problem a ten-year-old child could fix. But not Hannah Ginsberg. She'd drown in a saucer of tea.<br />\n<br />\nDov was a tall, lanky man, with great bushy eyebrows and dark, penetrating eyes; seventy-two years old, sinewy, and fit. He wore khaki shorts, sandals, and a tattered straw hat to shield his balding head. It was hot, bloody hot: perspiration was already coursing down his ruddy face. He should be at home, napping, before undertaking his daily afternoon of writing and research on one or another arcane topic of ancient Israeli archaeology.<br />\n<br />\nWhat better counterpoint to a life dedicated to duplicity and death? Since his first years at  Ein Gedi, Dov had become obsessed with deciphering the past. Now, in retirement, he could spend all the time he wanted exploring the ancient ruins, caves, and crevices on the Israeli side of the rift valley that had been home to man for the past four thousand years. In a moment of weakness, he had also agreed to use his once-feared organizational skills to help run Ein Gedi's Dead Sea Spa. That, he now knew, was a major mistake. He'd resign at the end of the year.<br />\n<br />\nHe walked into the coffee shop, glared at Hannah Ginsberg, and headed for the computer at the cashier's desk. Hannah shrugged, brought him a cup of tea, and then went back to wiping off the countertop. Avram Levy, the graying, pudgy kibbutz security guard, was at the food counter concentrating on his daily crossword puzzle. Three tables were filled with French tourists having an early afternoon snack.<br />\n<br />\nDov took a seat at the cashier's desk and glowered at the computer: an ancient, hulking IBM, an embarrassing relic. The kibbutz could never seem to find the money to buy a new one. Dov waited while it rebooted. It was like watching the tide come in.<br />\n<br />\nHopefully, he might still have an hour or so back at home before the American reporter arrived, a chance to shower, collect his thoughts. He was surprised at how rattled he'd been by the news. <br />\n<br />\nWas it age? Not at all. His mind was still fit. He'd had to deal with all kinds of alarming information during his long clandestine career. But he knew when to push the panic button, and he knew it was now.<br />\n<br />\nThe potential for disaster was far too fearsome to be ignored  -- and still he had hesitated. This was perilous ground. Let someone else act this time. He had spent too much of his life risking his skin for his country. Why put himself on the line again? <br />\n<br />\nEssentially, because he had no choice: he alone understood the danger. The consequences could be catastrophic--for Israel and the United States.<br />\n<br />\nHe'd considered his options. He could alert old Israeli contacts; he had an impressive network. But no, that wouldn't do. He had to reach out further for allies. He had to totally destroy the threat.<br />\n<br />\nSo he'd made the call.<br />\n<br />\nThe reporter would be here in a couple of hours.<br />\n<br />\nTogether they would expose the entire story to the world.<br />\n<br />\nHe vaguely saw the silver van come to a stop in the no parking zone next to the entrance to the spa. A young Arab-looking kid in jeans and a T-shirt got out and walked quickly away. A bit too quickly. \"Avram,\" said Dov, \"Why don't you check out the van.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe turned his attention back to the computer, but when there was no acknowledgement from the security guard, he looked up again to see the men's room door swinging shut. He glanced towards the window again. <br />\n<br />\nSuddenly there was a blinding flash.<br />\n<br />\nHe swore aloud, but his words were lost in a deafening blast that shattered the plate glass window before him.<br />\n<br />\nHe saw the silver van disintegrating as it hurtled toward him, and then there was nothing more to see.<br />\n<br />\nA giant claw ripped at his throat and lifted his body into the air, slowly, as if in a dream.", :pubDate=>2013-10-01 21:25:04 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-lando/israels-most-closelyguard_1_b_4025884.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-lando/israels-most-closelyguard_1_b_4025884.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 01:25:04 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Israel's Most Closely-Guarded Secret: A Second Excerpt"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

And what she uncovers is revelatory.<br />\n<br />\nHer solid research reveals the complex special interests -- corporate and government -- behind the Ad Council's lauded work. While she's quick to praise McGruff, which empowered neighborhood watch groups, or The UNCF for pushing societal betterment and exposing racism, she's evenhanded in her criticism, noting several spectacular failures, such as Smokey Bear, that masquerade as success. <br />\n<br />\nSmokey's tagline may be recognizable to millions of Americans, \"embedded in America's culture zeitgeist,\" notes Melillo, but to many Native Americans, he's suspect on land claims and usage. Plus, suppressing natural forest fires did tremendous harm to pristine acreage; it protected lumber interests, which were allowed to cut trees, rather than encourage sound ecological principles: low-watt fires burn off forest debris. The sad proof: the devastating wildfires in the Southwest over the past few summers. <br />\n<br />\nSimilarly, the Crying Indian, who shed a tear at the terrible pollution of America's natural resources, pushed a corporate agenda. Iron-Eyes Cody may have wept at our indifference to the earth, but he took individuals, not the giant corporate polluters to task. By focusing attention on careless campers, rather than bottle, chemical or plastic companies responsible for polluting our rivers and lands, the Keep America Beautiful campaign gave corporations a pass.  Moreover, KAB helped defeat legislation to stop the manufacture of throwaway bottles and demand corporate recycling. <br />\n<br />\nMelillo's book underscores the enormous power of advertising to push positive social policies, while chronicling the genesis of the Ad Council's most popular campaigns. All can be traced to the nature of the nonprofit organization, which debuted during World War II.<br />\n<br />\nThe Ad Council's campaigns are often clever and highly prized assignments, what CEO Peggy Conlon dubs \"advertising's gift to America.\" Many of the brightest minds in the business championed its efforts, birthing acclaimed PSAs (Public Service Announcements).  The template is for public service, which can be both hugely helpful, but also highly problematic. It's a delicate balancing act; tricky when business interests trump consumer protection. <br />\n<br />\nAn assistant professor of public communication at American University, as well as a former staff writer for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Adweek</i>, Mellillo is uniquely qualified to tackle the Ad Council's complex history. She vividly outlines the organization's inception, funding, key players and how campaigns are selected. (The Ad Council is a case study in balancing money, power and ego.)<br />\n<br />\nWhat's fascinating is how these iconic campaigns, including Rosie the Riveter and Anti-Communism, changed public behavior and influenced public policy. <i>How McGruff and the Crying Indian Changed America - A History of Iconic Ad Council Campaigns</i> is a thoughtful, well-researched examination of campaigns that baby boomers will recall fondly.  <br />\n<br />\nAfter all, most of us remember the taglines from key commercials; many watch the Super Bowl <i>only</i> for the commercials.  Advertising is a potent reminder of copywriters' abilities to entertain and enlighten, as well as distort and subvert the social order.<br />\n<br />\nFor anyone interested in the compelling elements of American advertising history and the nature of social messaging, Melillo's insightful and eye-opening book is a must-read.", :pubDate=>2013-10-01 18:49:53 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fern-siegel/book-review-how-mcgruff-a_b_4023474.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fern-siegel/book-review-how-mcgruff-a_b_4023474.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Tue, 01 Oct 2013 22:49:53 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Review: How McGruff and the Crying Indian Changed America"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]
