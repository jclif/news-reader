The most forgotten of its forgotten wars. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>It was one act in a three-act tragedy that, from Bosnia to Kosovo, and from Libya and Syria, unfolded according to the same invariable scenario.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>And it was a non-subject for scholars, a no man's land for knowledge. It was, in fact, little more than a name -- \"the Bangladesh war,\" as exotic as it was distant -- that was in the process of being erased from the collective memory of the West.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Until the arrival of a memorable book by Princeton University professor Gary Bass. <i>The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide</i> (Knopf) returns to this story and, while doing justice to the war's victims, also, for the first time, draws out for us its lessons. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>We discover right off the bat that genocide (the war in Bangladesh was indeed an attempt at genocide) could occur so soon after Auschwitz without capturing the attention of the world at large or even, with rare exceptions such as André Malraux, any of its prominent individual consciences. That fact became overwhelmingly evident in Bangladesh.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>We witness the origins of the terms of a debate that has continued, practically unaltered, for 40 years: intervention or noninterference? Humanity: singular or plural? Is there an established natural right -- is there an international law -- that can be cited against a dictator who slaughters his own people, or do rights and laws exist only within the borders of nations, and too bad about those who have the misfortune to have been born in Jessore or Dacca? Does the idea of a universal conscience and, related to it, an international community, have any meaning, or must we settle for Goebbels's sadly famous theorem that a man's home is his castle? </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Bass shows us how small causes (Kissinger's liking for the Pakistani dictator, Yahya Khan, a drunken brute) can have large and horrifying effects: a terrible war that lasted nearly a year and exacted a death toll still unknown (300,000? 500,000? A million or more?), but which, as Bass shows, followed the same pattern as the ongoing war in Syria, where the escalation to extremes can be explained, at least in part, by the manner in which Vladimir Putin has poured in weapons and advisers. The Bangladesh war lasted as long as it did only because the Putin of that era, a man by the name of Richard Nixon, was stubbornly persistent in his support of someone whom he saw as an Asian reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>The book also shows, conversely, how lone individuals can stand in the way of the killing machine and, after a long, agonizingly long period of crying out in the wilderness, finish by being heard. In this case, that individual was not a war reporter running the blockade on pictures from the front; nor was it an intellectual forcing the world, in the manner later adopted in the United States by the late and much-lamented Christopher Hitchens, to see that which it would prefer not to see -- no, in this case, the individuals in question were a handful of \"petty\" diplomats, such as the American consul general in Dacca, the aptly named Archer Blood, who, after dozens of cables warning the administration of the responsibility it was incurring through its support of the bloodbath, joined 19 of his colleagues in making public a \"blood telegram\" that cut short his career but pricked the world's conscience and led to India's intervention. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>And finally Bass shows us how a strong political will -- at the time, that of Indira Gandhi -- can, when it is harnessed to morality and law, put an end to temporizing. Except for the cast, it's the same movie that we watched 20 years later in Bosnia and 40 years later in Libya and Mali. Without succumbing to otherworldliness or to the idealization of an Indian prime minister who had her dark side (and how!), the book is also a tribute to politics in its true sense, to a politics that is not afraid to turn history away from subservience to the supposedly inexorable facts, or, better, to stage a coup against history.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Many readers will not be aware of my deep attachment to beautiful Bangladesh, whose war of liberation I covered more than 40 years ago for the newspaper <i>Combat</i> (founded by Albert Camus), where I met and mixed with the nation's liberator, Mujibur Rahman (father of the current, courageous prime minister), and of which I chronicled the tragic and noble birth in my very first book, <i>Les Indes rouges</i>. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>But I do want readers to be aware of the appearance of Gary Bass' book, which I hope will be widely read (and translated into French!) because it places a spotlight on one of the most terribly neglected corners of the world. (The cities of the Ganges delta are so poor and powerless that, like Nineveh, Canopus, Heraklion and Meroë, they live under the constant threat of being swallowed up by supposedly natural catastrophes that the world now has all of the necessary technical means to prevent should it choose to do so.) And because it tells a modern story that we have seen repeated so many times: To understand the recurrent cowardice of the West, its blindness, and the sonorous vacuum that envelopes even the theory of the international community today, a return to Bangladesh is required reading. </p><br />\n<br />\n<em><p>Translated by Steven B.

Cuarón said of the young actor, \"I am so full of admiration on how he's handling his career. I'm so filled with admiration for him. He's so smart and has amazing taste.\" And then he added, \"I would love to do something with him again. I'm a big fan, man. In your article you can quote me, because he's one actor I would love to work with again.\" <br />\n<br />\nAs it happened, the next interview on this reporter's slate was Radcliffe, who is now promoting the Sundance Film Festival favorite \"Kill Your Darlings\" (due in theaters on Oct. 16). We let Radcliffe read the nice words his former \"Harry Potter\" director said about him. Below is Radcliffe's response to Cuarón -- and his opinion of how Cuarón completely changed the course of the Harry Potter franchise.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Radcliffe:</strong> [Reading] \"Send my love to the bastard\" [laughs]. \"Send my love to the <i>amazing</i> bastard.\"<br />\n<br />\n<strong>He went on record that he wants to do another movie with you. I think people would like that.</strong><br />\nWell, that's awesome. I would love to. He's such a fine director and I <i>really</i> want to see \"Gravity.\" <br />\n<br />\n<strong>It's great.</strong><br />\nIt also just looks <i>terrifying</i>. It looks like the kind of thing that I personally have nightmares about. Have you ever read \"The Martian Chronicles\" by Ray Bradbury? He wrote a story in \"The Martian Chronicles\" where you just get launched into space -- and that terrifies me. So the trailer for \"Gravity\" scares the shit out of me already. He's a pretty stunning filmmaker.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Now, looking back, just how different was it going from Chris Columbus for the first two movies to Cuarón for \"Prisoner of Azkaban\"?</strong><br />\nI mean, it was. It was <i>very</i> different. But it was also like, I think it's the best decision that was ever made for the series. Because it just changed how people saw us and it changed the perception of what we were trying to do. \"Oh, they're trying to make something different!\" He had just come off \"Y Tu Mamá También,\" so that was people's frame of reference for Alfonso.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Or, back then, for a lot of people who don't pay close attention to movies, \"Who?\"</strong><br />\nYeah, absolutely. But I think it's just what he did with the film was so extraordinary, and it's <i>still</i> many people's favorite of all of the Potters. I think he did wonders for the series and all of us. That was the film where I was suddenly of an age for the first time where I was able to <i>be directed</i> by him -- more than I had been capable of being in the past. And, also, I was suddenly, working with Gary Oldman and David Thewlis and whereas all the older actors in the first two movies had known me as a kid, they hadn't. They only know me as a 14-year-old, so they treat me as a young man rather than a boy. And I think that whole film is a huge turning point -- it's really where I decided that I wanted to be and absolutely continue to be an actor.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

Your options for your homepage design are vast, but having strong and inviting homepage text can sometimes be enough to keep readers browsing your site. <br />\n<br />\nOne strategy we’ve found to be effective in keeping your audience interested is to write a letter for your homepage. Simply put, your Dear Visitor letter can be a blurb that talks about your writing and yourself as a writer—essentially, a welcome letter. Think about what you want to know about an author when you visit his/her website, and then answer some of those questions about yourself. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>What To Ask Yourself Before Writing Your Dear Visitor Letter</strong><br />\nWhat are some of your interests aside from writing? Is there anything new and exciting going on in your life right now? Do you have an email list or any social media platforms where your readers can follow you? What are some of the themes of your work? Do you ever host contests or giveaways as incentives for your readership? Do you have a link to your most recent publication? What do you see for yourself in the future? What are you currently penning?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Assembling Your Dear Visitor Letter</strong><br />\nAfter you’ve answered some or all of those questions, it’s time to put the letter together. Of course, there’s a format for that! As always, you’ll want to begin with a salutation (a “Dear Visitor” would be fitting!). <br />\n<br />\nThen, you’ll want to welcome your readers to kick off their shoes and stick around awhile, in your own unique way. Next, include the answers to the questions above. In your last paragraphs, you’ll want to lead your readers in a specific direction (ask them to visit another part of the site, sign up for your mailing list, follow you on Twitter, etc.). <br />\n<br />\nAnd, finally, your signature! You can choose to type your name or use a graphic image of your signature (be careful using your full name—identity theft is a huge problem these days!). You should save the image file with your name as the file name (for example, John_Smith.jpg) with the alternate text and description including your name as well. This will ensure that Google will associate the image with your name. <br />\n<br />\nWe all know there’s nothing worse than a bunch of typos on a writer’s website, so be sure to have your Dear Visitor letter looked over by a professional proofreader before you post it to your homepage.

I looked into the unfamiliar titles and read three. <em>Janey and Me: Growing Up with My Mother</em> by Virginia Ironside was a revelation, an extremely well written and revealing family portrait by the journalist author about her mother who rose to become Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art despite not being an academic.<br />\n<br />\nMore curious was Pete's assessment of Ozzy Osbourne's <em>I Am Ozzy</em> as rock's best memoir. I would not have pegged Pete as an Ozzy fan, and surprised that he would have even cracked it open. It was delightful, a showcase for Ozzy's natural humor and a memory much more intact than the addled state he displayed on <em>The Osbourne's.</em><br />\n<br />\nI wasn't a fan of Ozzy's original band, Black Sabbath, but I did see them play live, twice. The first time, in November 1971 at the Long Beach Arena, it was as though Ozzy was in an alternate universe. The band was playing grinding, serious music, and here was Ozzy delightfully grinning as though he had disembarked from a ride at Disneyland. Ozzy, his shirt off, good-naturedly waved his arms as he sang songs titled \"Wicked World,\" \"Children of the Grave,\" \"War Pigs\" and \"Paranoid.\" He configured his hands into V-sign peace symbols, and gestured just like President Nixon. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I interviewed Ozzy months later at a house in Bel-Air the band was renting, for an article that ran in the UCLA <em>Daily Bruin</em>, he explained that the band's music had a positive, cathartic affect on their fans. Seeing the band in concert, they were able to relieve their frustrations. I hadn't thought that a band with a gloomy outlook, with references to Lucifer, nightmares, witchcraft and the supernatural, could make listeners overtly happy. I was surprised when Ozzy named the upbeat Beatles his favorite musical artist. (Truth be told, bassist Geezer Butler supplied most of the horror-laden lyrics.) On top of it all, Ozzy was a willing and engaging conversationalist. He invited me to the band's recording session that evening.<br />\n<br />\nLittle did I suspect that the company Richard Foos and I started, the Rhino Records label, would be issuing Black Sabbath records three decades later. But it almost didn't happen. Sharon Osbourne was now representing the financial interests of not only her husband but the other members of the band. It was almost comical. It was as if she and Ozzy were lounging on the sofa, snickering, watching <em>Austin Powers.</em> Taking a cue from Dr. Evil, they concocted a demand for \"one million dollars!\"\t\t<br />\n<br />\nIt was outrageous because we weren't getting anything new.  In the U.S., Black Sabbath recorded for Warner Brothers Records. They were paid an advance on their royalties for each album they recorded, and then subsequent royalties as their advances were recouped from sales on the albums. Rhino didn't want to have Black Sabbath record anything new, merely to do a great job on reissuing the catalogue, initially with a box set of the original lineup's first eight albums. In re-signing with Warner's in the seventies, the band's representative inserted a clause that gave the group approval of any new configuration of the recordings, and Sharon was hitting up Rhino on behalf of her client or they wouldn't approve. It was a pure money grab. There was little consideration for the fine work that Rhino normally does, or the desire to create quality product. There was a stalemate for a couple of years, but Sharon got her advance. In the composition of any book, the writer has to determine what to leave it and what to take out. There's more to the Black Sabbath story, but as the reissues didn't come out until Richard and I had left the company, I didn't think it appropriate to include in the book.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Harold Bronson's book THE RHINO RECORDS STORY will be published on October 22nd.</em>", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 08:27:54 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-bronson/the-rhino-records-story-t_1_b_4025753.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-bronson/the-rhino-records-story-t_1_b_4025753.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 12:27:54 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Rhino Records Story Takes Shape Part 3: Sharon Osbourne Says 'One Million Dollars!'"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

(AP) — The captain of the American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates four years ago returned home from sea to another hero's welcome — this time for a sneak peek of the Tom Hanks movie about the ordeal.<br />\n<br />\n\"Captain Phillips\" got an early screening Tuesday night at a benefit in Richard Phillips' home state of Vermont ahead of its national release in theaters on Oct. 11. Phillips got a rousing standing ovation after he addressed the packed theater. He said the movie was entertainment but the benefit showing was an opportunity to raise money for a Champlain College scholarship in honor of a 2012 graduate who died. The event also gave him a chance to honor the military and say thanks to his crew and Vermont community, who he said helped him and his family in a time of need.<br />\n<br />\n\"The military — they are the true heroes in my story,\" said Phillips, who was introduced by former Gov. Jim Douglas.<br />\n<br />\nHanks plays Phillips in Paul Greengrass' docudrama adapted from the captain's memoir about the April 2009 hijacking. The actor kept Phillips' beard and eyeglasses in the movie, but he didn't speak with the merchant ship captain's strong New England accent.<br />\n<br />\nPhillips spent five days as a hostage of Somali pirates on a lifeboat after the Maersk Alabama was hijacked. He was beaten, tied up and threatened before he was rescued days later by U.S. Navy SEALs, who shot three of the pirates.<br />\n<br />\nBefore the screening, he said he never felt empathy for the Somali pirates.<br />\n<br />\n\"That never entered my mind,\" Phillips said in an interview. \"We were always adversaries. I thought it was important to make sure we both knew we were adversaries in that. I thought that was important for me and my survival. There was no Stockholm syndrome.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe sneak peak in Williston was a benefit for a fund created in honor of Sarah Elizabeth Ramsey, who died in June after being struck by a car in New York City. Ramsey had dated Phillips' nephew.<br />\n<br />\nThe fund was established by Ramsey's friends and family for third- and fourth-year marketing students who want to expand their professional and international experiences. The scholarship will be awarded each year. Ramsey spent a semester in Lima, Peru, during her junior year and completed an eight-week advertising internship in Shanghai, China, before graduating.<br />\n<br />\n\"Captain Phillips\" is expected to be a major contender during Hollywood's awards season.

In total, Schulz's work, formerly known as \"Lil' Folks,\" reached 75 countries in 2,600 different papers and was published in an impressive 21 languages every day. Perhaps Syracuse University professor Robert Thompson put it best when he famously described \"Peanuts\" as \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/arts/charles-m-schulz-peanuts-creator-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm\" target=\"_hplink\">arguably the longest story ever told by one human being</a>.\"<br />\n<br />\nGenerations of Americans and comic enthusiasts around the globe continue to cherish \"Peanuts,\" whether it's through holiday television productions, theatrical works or even amusement parks.

Did I mention that I'm superstitious and I believe in ghosts? However, I do enjoy researching and writing about them--the creepier the better. I even braved standing outside of Lilburn Mansion, one of the real haunted locations in \"Unbreakable,\" to film a video about the book (which <a href=\"http://www.kamigarcia.com/the-unbreakable-book-trailer-is-here/\" target=\"_hplink\">you can watch here</a>).

Tours are available, but violent deaths in the solitary confinement area and the boiler room have resulted in too much poltergeist activity for my taste.   <br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"waverly sanatorium\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1383353/thumbs/o-WAVERLY-SANATORIUM-570.jpg?6\" /><br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Waverly Sanatorium in Louisville, Kentucky: </strong>This hospital opened in 1910 to treat tuberculosis patients. But experimental procedures and tuberculosis itself lead to insanity or death for 6,000 patients during the 52 years Waverly Hills was open. The paranormal activity includes: a little girl on the third floor who plays hide and seek with visitors and an old woman with bloody wrists screaming for help. Still, there are plans to turn this historic building into a hotel (which you can bet I won't be staying at any time soon).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Bell Witch Farm in Adams, Tennessee:</strong> An unseen force terrorized the Bell family with everything from rat and insect infestation to physical torment. The entity claimed to be the spirit of Kate Batts, a neighbor who was cheated by John Bell. Her goals were simple: kill John Bell and stop his daughter Betsy from marrying a neighbor boy - both of which she achieved. If you've brave enough, you can take a tour of the Bell Witch Cave and a reproduction of the Bells' cabin. The original home was torn down for safety purposes (not a great indicator of a choice vacation spot).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Devil's Road in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania:</strong> Street signs were removed, which makes it difficult to locate this windy road just north of the Delaware border. The abundance of \"No Trespassing\" notices discourages exploring if you find it. So why is the Devil's Road so creepy? Follow it long enough and you'll see the infamous Cult House, which has plenty of disturbing rumors surrounding it. The trees lining the road all lean steeply away from the road - and the house.

The ghosts are said to include a woman whose screams have led the Philadelphia police to investigate (only to find no one there), a faceless man, a tour guide in Revolutionary clothing, and plenty of children and dogs. Fort Mifflin is worth checking out for its historical significance, but if you have a run-in with the faceless man, don't say I didn't warn you.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"stull cemetery\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1383342/thumbs/o-STULL-CEMETERY-570.jpg?3\" /><br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Stull Cemetery in Stull, Kansas:</strong> For a tiny town near Topeka, Stull has had more than its share of paranormal action.

The boy and his family stayed in this St. Louis house after the word \"Louis\" appeared above his ribs.

He had been talking for several years about his desire to write the 'spy novel to end all spy novels'. But his attention had simply drifted in other directions. <br />\n<br />\nAfter hostilities ended, he had been recruited as Foreign Manager of another London-based newspaper, <em>the Sunday Times</em>, a job that required him to build up a network of foreign correspondents, not so different from the agents with whom he liaised when he was the influential war-time Personal Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral John Godfrey.<br />\n<br />\nIn that earlier job, he had been Godfrey's gate-keeper in Room 39 of the Admiralty. He dealt directly with MI6 and the other secret services on behalf of his boss. He saw agents going to and returning from the field. He played a major role in liaising on intelligence matters with President Roosevelt's special enjoy, Colonel \"Wild\" Bill Donovan, whom he visited in Washington in the summer of 1941 and helped draw up guidelines for the combined US intelligence agency which would later become the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and then the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). One of his memos detailing the ideal American agent seems in retrospect to anticipate the qualities of James Bond. Donovan later presented him with a .38 Colt Police Positive revolver inscribed \"For Special Services.\"<br />\n<br />\nFleming was essentially a bureaucrat during the war. But, being an imaginative man (he had written poetry in his youth), he could not help thinking about a more active role as a secret agent. <br />\n<br />\nBefore James Bond could make his first appearance at Royale Les Eaux in Casino Royale, however, Fleming had to get his own life in order. <br />\n<br />\nWith his considerable chutzpah, he negotiated a fantastic deal with his new employer, Kemsley Newspapers (which owned <em>the Sunday Times</em>), which meant he was paid £5000 a year and able to take off three months of the year.<br />\n<br />\nThis was just what he wanted because the other main post-war ambition was to build himself a house in Jamaica. This came about after he had fallen in love with the Caribbean island during an Anglo-American naval conference there in 1942. He vowed he would come back there to live. So one of his first initiatives in late 1945 was to buy himself some land on the north coast of Jamaica, near Oracabessa. <br />\n<br />\nThere, he built a basic bungalow which he called Goldeneye, after a secret war-time intelligence operation he had run (involving contingency plans if Hitler had moved into the Iberian peninsula). One of his first guests was the entertainer Noel Coward who was scornful of the facilities and referred to his stay at \"Golden eye, nose and throat\" (clinic was implied).<br />\n <br />\nBut Fleming loved snorkelling and exploring the sea round his house. And he entertained many friends, eager to flee the British winter and post-war austerity. <br />\n<br />\nAmong his visitors was Ann, Lady Rothermere, who had told her husband that she was visiting her friend Noel Coward who had his own house, Blue Harbour, three miles from Goldeneye. She bore Fleming a still-born daughter, and then when she became pregnant by him again, she obtained a divorce and came out to Jamaica to marry her lover.<br />\n<br />\nThis was not exactly on Fleming's commitment-averse agenda. It also brought other factors into play. While in London, Ann had surrounded herself with writers and artists at her then marital home, Warwick House. She was a friend of Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, Patrick Leigh Fermor and others. Fleming felt that a book might be a useful entrée into this circle. <br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, his own elder brother Peter had forged a successful career as a writer, and, only the previous summer, he had published his own spoof espionage novel, The Sixth Column. <br />\n<br />\nDriven by a desire to impress his wife and by fraternal competitiveness, Ian settled down in Goldeneye to write \"Casino Royale.\" The fictional venue in Northern France and the gambling ambience reflected his pre-war days as a playboy bachelor. The escapist story line and the suggestion of a better life gave hope to Britons just beginning to experience modern consumerism. The plot drew on his close liaison with the intelligence services. The theme of betrayal, epitomized by Vesper Lynd's treatment of Bond, tallied with emerging information (to which Fleming was privy) about the disappearance of British diplomats, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, who were suspected of being Soviet spies. And the hero of the novel was James Bond, Fleming's alter ego, the action man he would have so loved to have been. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.andrewlycett.co.uk/\" target=\"_hplink\">Andrew Lycett's</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ian-Fleming-Andrew-Lycett/dp/1250037980\" target=\"_hplink\">\"Ian Fleming\" is published by St Martin's Press [$29.99]</a>.

And in Vietnam, they surely would have seconded the words of David Douglas Duncan, a Marine photographer during World War II in the Pacific, the great photographer in Korea (for Life magazine), and present with a camera in the ferocious battle for Khe Sanh in 1968. He said about his Korean photographs: “I wanted to show what war did to a man... I wanted to tell a story of war, as war has always been for men through the ages. Only their weapons, the terrain, the causes have changed.”<br />\n<br />\nThe AP photographers in Vietnam—as this book shows—wanted to do the same, as did such others as Tim Page, Larry Burrows, and Kyoichi Sawada, who worked alongside them. But they carried out their task beyond the earlier visions of Capa and Duncan. Each, in different ways, was showing what war did to all human beings. Not simply to the warriors, but to the civilians. In Vietnam, it was often impossible to separate them. Day after day, hour after hour, the photographers reminded us that these civilians were more than mere statistics. They were human beings.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"vietnam photo 1\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1384021/thumbs/o-VIETNAM-PHOTO-1-570.jpg?1\" /><br />\n<br />\nMany photographers moved in and out of the AP bureau during the Vietnam War. Some were freelancers, offering their film for a price (in Browne’s day it was $5 a photo). But those on staff were among the best who ever practiced their dangerous craft. Consider, for purposes of compression, only these names: Horst Faas, Eddie Adams, Henri Huet, Nick Ut, Dang Van Phuoc.<br />\n<br />\nFaas was a burly man, born in Berlin in 1933, the same year that Adolf Hitler came to power. When he was nine, he was compelled, like all other German kids his age, to join Hitler Youth. Later, he remembered the war for his constant hunger, and for the oddly beautiful sight of American bombers in the sky, and tracer bullets trying to destroy them. At war’s end, his parents took him and the other Faas children out of the devastation of Berlin, fearful of the arrival of the Red Army, and they made their way to the West. His education was eclectic (it included eight years of Latin and a course in journalism that stopped at Gutenberg), but at eighteen he found a job as a clerk for the Keystone photo agency in Munich. His job: helping to comb through a roomful of several million photographs, organizing them into files. He first learned about photographs by studying them. Within a few years, he was carrying a camera and making them. By 1951, he was covering major stories in Europe, including the 1954 peace conference in Geneva about a place on the other side of the globe: Indochina. Just before Christmas, 1955, he was hired by the AP. He was soon in Bonn, the capital of West Germany. He was the AP’s only photographer in that city, with competition from UPI and the German press. He had no guidance. Just assignments from Frankfurt or New York.<br />\n<br />\n“I didn’t know what I was doing,” he remembered years later, “and I had to follow my peers from the opposition to see what and how we worked there.” <br />\n<br />\nAt the AP he was handed a Speed Graphic, a camera that he hated for its clumsiness and the way focusing sometimes robbed him of that “decisive moment.” But it was the AP. And the AP was driven with urgency.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"vietnam photo 2\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1384025/thumbs/o-VIETNAM-PHOTO-2-570.jpg?1\" /><br />\n<br />\n“Working for AP,” he remembered, “it was always that you worked in fear. Fear of the events that have not happened yet... And it invariably happened at three in the morning.”<br />\n<br />\nAfter five years in Bonn, the AP sent him to his first war: in the Belgian Congo. He had volunteered for the assignment. He thought he would be in the Congo for a few weeks, and parked his car at the airport. He would be gone for a year and a half. But he didn’t mind. At last he had a chance to make good pictures in a truly bad place. Out there, in the great wide world, with a Leica he had paid for himself. First stop: Leopoldville.<br />\n<br />\n“It was my chance to get into international journalism,” he said later, “and I used it and jumped and never came back.”<br />\nIn the Congo, tribal forces, regular Congolese army troops, and United Nations peacekeepers were fighting one another in a country of rivers, swamps, and jungle. Faas met other correspondents, including a small group from Fleet Street, and a young man from the New York Times named David Halberstam, who was then twenty-seven, passionate and intense about his craft. They were present together at some of the battles in the three-way combat in Katanga. Other times Faas went alone into fierce combat and, when he returned to Leopoldville, would brief Halberstam (and some other reporters). Sometimes Halberstam introduced Faas to people the German could not easily meet, including U.S. Embassy analysts and CIA spooks. Horst and David became friends for life.<br />\n<br />\n“Yeah, he was a friendly American,” Faas later said, “as authoritative as he always was. He always taught us to be serious journalists, dress seriously and act seriously, and responsibly... Not play around with the world of news.”<br />\n<br />\nAfter a year and a half, a worn-out Faas told his AP bosses that he wanted to go skiing. He had seen enough victims of assassinations, torture, and treachery in the exhausting heat of the Congo. They agreed that he could leave and thanked him for a job well done. He went skiing in Tours. A few days later, he was called by the AP in Paris and told to go to Algeria. Another war, marked by assassinations, torture, and treachery, was under way in an outpost of the eroding French Empire. Faas went. The war was almost impossible to cover, and very dangerous, particularly for reporters and photographers. Many of them had been marked for killing. The killers might have pledged allegiance to Algerian nationalism, to continued French sovereignty, to Islam, to simple vengeance for old injuries. The cause didn’t matter. The effect was death. Not simply in Algeria, but increasingly from the right-wing OAS, in the heart of Paris. Faas did his best for ten weeks, and then got another call from the AP bosses. Now they wanted him to go to Laos. In Indochina.<br />\n<br />\nIn Laos, he met Peter Arnett and confronted another baffling, three-sided local struggle, with Americans from the virtually faceless CIA controlling all access to the action. Or actively preventing that access. And then Arnett and Faas were told to move on to Saigon. To help cover the Buddhist crisis. That destination, and the work they performed there for the AP, would define the lives of both men.<br />\n<br />\n<em>© 2013 Deidre Enterprises, Inc.</em><br />\n<br />\n<HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--319345--HH>", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 07:51:07 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/vietnam-photo-book_n_4025836.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/vietnam-photo-book_n_4025836.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 11:51:07 UTC +00:00], ["title", "New Book Collects Most Startling Photos From The Vietnam War"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

He'd been looking forward to an afternoon at home on the kibbutz when the call came. It was Hannah Ginsberg at the kibbutz's spa, a quarter mile away by the turgid, gunmetal waters of the Dead Sea. The computer had crashed -- again.<br />\n<br />\n\"So? Reboot,\" said Dov.<br />\n<br />\n\"I did. Still doesn't work.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"What about Schmuel?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"In Beersheba.\"<br />\n<br />\nSon of a bitch. The entire spa paralyzed because of a Paleolithic computer and a klutzy manager. So here he was: Dov Ben-David, the former deputy director of Israel's feared Mossad, the man responsible for liquidating anyone who posed a mortal threat to the Jewish State -- from Palestinian terrorists to Iranian nuclear scientists -- here he was, turning his day upside down to deal with a problem a ten-year-old child could fix. But not Hannah Ginsberg. She'd drown in a saucer of tea.<br />\n<br />\nDov was a tall, lanky man, with great bushy eyebrows and dark, penetrating eyes; seventy-two years old, sinewy, and fit. He wore khaki shorts, sandals, and a tattered straw hat to shield his balding head. It was hot, bloody hot: perspiration was already coursing down his ruddy face. He should be at home, napping, before undertaking his daily afternoon of writing and research on one or another arcane topic of ancient Israeli archaeology.<br />\n<br />\nWhat better counterpoint to a life dedicated to duplicity and death? Since his first years at  Ein Gedi, Dov had become obsessed with deciphering the past. Now, in retirement, he could spend all the time he wanted exploring the ancient ruins, caves, and crevices on the Israeli side of the rift valley that had been home to man for the past four thousand years. In a moment of weakness, he had also agreed to use his once-feared organizational skills to help run Ein Gedi's Dead Sea Spa. That, he now knew, was a major mistake. He'd resign at the end of the year.<br />\n<br />\nHe walked into the coffee shop, glared at Hannah Ginsberg, and headed for the computer at the cashier's desk. Hannah shrugged, brought him a cup of tea, and then went back to wiping off the countertop. Avram Levy, the graying, pudgy kibbutz security guard, was at the food counter concentrating on his daily crossword puzzle. Three tables were filled with French tourists having an early afternoon snack.<br />\n<br />\nDov took a seat at the cashier's desk and glowered at the computer: an ancient, hulking IBM, an embarrassing relic. The kibbutz could never seem to find the money to buy a new one. Dov waited while it rebooted. It was like watching the tide come in.<br />\n<br />\nHopefully, he might still have an hour or so back at home before the American reporter arrived, a chance to shower, collect his thoughts. He was surprised at how rattled he'd been by the news. <br />\n<br />\nWas it age? Not at all. His mind was still fit. He'd had to deal with all kinds of alarming information during his long clandestine career. But he knew when to push the panic button, and he knew it was now.<br />\n<br />\nThe potential for disaster was far too fearsome to be ignored  -- and still he had hesitated. This was perilous ground. Let someone else act this time. He had spent too much of his life risking his skin for his country. Why put himself on the line again? <br />\n<br />\nEssentially, because he had no choice: he alone understood the danger. The consequences could be catastrophic--for Israel and the United States.<br />\n<br />\nHe'd considered his options. He could alert old Israeli contacts; he had an impressive network. But no, that wouldn't do. He had to reach out further for allies. He had to totally destroy the threat.<br />\n<br />\nSo he'd made the call.<br />\n<br />\nThe reporter would be here in a couple of hours.<br />\n<br />\nTogether they would expose the entire story to the world.<br />\n<br />\nHe vaguely saw the silver van come to a stop in the no parking zone next to the entrance to the spa. A young Arab-looking kid in jeans and a T-shirt got out and walked quickly away. A bit too quickly. \"Avram,\" said Dov, \"Why don't you check out the van.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe turned his attention back to the computer, but when there was no acknowledgement from the security guard, he looked up again to see the men's room door swinging shut. He glanced towards the window again. <br />\n<br />\nSuddenly there was a blinding flash.<br />\n<br />\nHe swore aloud, but his words were lost in a deafening blast that shattered the plate glass window before him.<br />\n<br />\nHe saw the silver van disintegrating as it hurtled toward him, and then there was nothing more to see.<br />\n<br />\nA giant claw ripped at his throat and lifted his body into the air, slowly, as if in a dream.", :pubDate=>2013-10-01 21:25:04 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-lando/israels-most-closelyguard_1_b_4025884.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-lando/israels-most-closelyguard_1_b_4025884.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 01:25:04 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Israel's Most Closely-Guarded Secret: A Second Excerpt"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

And what she uncovers is revelatory.<br />\n<br />\nHer solid research reveals the complex special interests -- corporate and government -- behind the Ad Council's lauded work. While she's quick to praise McGruff, which empowered neighborhood watch groups, or The UNCF for pushing societal betterment and exposing racism, she's evenhanded in her criticism, noting several spectacular failures, such as Smokey Bear, that masquerade as success. <br />\n<br />\nSmokey's tagline may be recognizable to millions of Americans, \"embedded in America's culture zeitgeist,\" notes Melillo, but to many Native Americans, he's suspect on land claims and usage. Plus, suppressing natural forest fires did tremendous harm to pristine acreage; it protected lumber interests, which were allowed to cut trees, rather than encourage sound ecological principles: low-watt fires burn off forest debris. The sad proof: the devastating wildfires in the Southwest over the past few summers. <br />\n<br />\nSimilarly, the Crying Indian, who shed a tear at the terrible pollution of America's natural resources, pushed a corporate agenda. Iron-Eyes Cody may have wept at our indifference to the earth, but he took individuals, not the giant corporate polluters to task. By focusing attention on careless campers, rather than bottle, chemical or plastic companies responsible for polluting our rivers and lands, the Keep America Beautiful campaign gave corporations a pass.  Moreover, KAB helped defeat legislation to stop the manufacture of throwaway bottles and demand corporate recycling. <br />\n<br />\nMelillo's book underscores the enormous power of advertising to push positive social policies, while chronicling the genesis of the Ad Council's most popular campaigns. All can be traced to the nature of the nonprofit organization, which debuted during World War II.<br />\n<br />\nThe Ad Council's campaigns are often clever and highly prized assignments, what CEO Peggy Conlon dubs \"advertising's gift to America.\" Many of the brightest minds in the business championed its efforts, birthing acclaimed PSAs (Public Service Announcements).  The template is for public service, which can be both hugely helpful, but also highly problematic. It's a delicate balancing act; tricky when business interests trump consumer protection. <br />\n<br />\nAn assistant professor of public communication at American University, as well as a former staff writer for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Adweek</i>, Mellillo is uniquely qualified to tackle the Ad Council's complex history. She vividly outlines the organization's inception, funding, key players and how campaigns are selected. (The Ad Council is a case study in balancing money, power and ego.)<br />\n<br />\nWhat's fascinating is how these iconic campaigns, including Rosie the Riveter and Anti-Communism, changed public behavior and influenced public policy. <i>How McGruff and the Crying Indian Changed America - A History of Iconic Ad Council Campaigns</i> is a thoughtful, well-researched examination of campaigns that baby boomers will recall fondly.  <br />\n<br />\nAfter all, most of us remember the taglines from key commercials; many watch the Super Bowl <i>only</i> for the commercials.  Advertising is a potent reminder of copywriters' abilities to entertain and enlighten, as well as distort and subvert the social order.<br />\n<br />\nFor anyone interested in the compelling elements of American advertising history and the nature of social messaging, Melillo's insightful and eye-opening book is a must-read.", :pubDate=>2013-10-01 18:49:53 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fern-siegel/book-review-how-mcgruff-a_b_4023474.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fern-siegel/book-review-how-mcgruff-a_b_4023474.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Tue, 01 Oct 2013 22:49:53 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Review: How McGruff and the Crying Indian Changed America"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 14:44:58 UTC +00:00]]

Raymond Chandler's<strong> Philip Marlowe </strong>and Mickey Spillane's<strong> Mike Hammer </strong>were among the answers.  So, too, of course was Dashiell Hammett's <strong>Sam Spade</strong>.  How could he not be with lines like this from \"The Maltese Falcon?\"<br />\n<br />\n<em>\"When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it.  It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him.\"</em>  <img alt=\"2013-09-30-TheMalteseFalconthumb560xauto26104.gif\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-30-TheMalteseFalconthumb560xauto26104.gif\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\" /><br />\n<br />\nMore contemporary tough guys like <strong>Dave Robicheaux </strong>from James Lee Burke's novels, <strong>Matt Scudder </strong>from Lawrence Block and <strong>Easy Rawlins </strong>from Walter Mosley were also on the list.  So, too, were<strong> Spenser </strong>and <strong>Travis McGee</strong>.  I think those two iconic tough guys display a tad too much sentimentality to be considered old-school hard-boiled, but no one can deny that Robert B. Parker and John D. MacDonald created protagonists who will live forever.  The occasional female character also cropped up.  <strong>Lisbeth Salander</strong>, from Stieg Larsson's \"The Girl...\" series, made an appearance, as did Sara Peretsky's <strong>V.I. Warshawski</strong>.<br />\n<br />\nBut the name that blindsided me was <strong>Jake Lassiter</strong>, the linebacker-turned-lawyer in 10 of <em>my</em> novels, including the recently released \"State vs. Lassiter.\"<br />\n<br />\nFunny thing is, just as with Spenser and Travis McGee, Jake never seemed that hard-boiled to me.  Oh, there's the occasional tough-guy line: \"They don't call us sharks for our ability to swim.\"  <br />\n<br />\nThen there's his comment about the sign to be found in every Miami courtroom: \"We Who Labor Here Seek Only Truth.\"  Jake's rejoinder: \"Subject to the truth being concealed by lying witnesses, distorted by sleazy lawyers, and excluded by inept judges.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut is that enough?  To determine whether Jake is hard-boiled or merely cynical, I recently had a not-too-friendly conversation with him:<br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You look like you're still in shape to play for the Miami Dolphins.  How do you do it?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Being fictional helps.  By the way, you look like pelican crap.  </em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You're just peeved because I got you indicted for murder in the new book.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  I don't get \"peeved.\"  I get pissed, and when I do, someone gets decked.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  Let me ask you a tough question.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Take your best shot, scribbler.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You've been called many things.  \"Shyster.\"  \"Mouthpiece.\"  \"Shark.\"  But murderer?  <br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  I'm not bad.  You just write me that way.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  Okay, in <a href=\"http://www.paul-levine.com/series/state-vs-lassiter/\" target=\"_hplink\">\"State vs. Lassiter,\"</a>  your client's money goes missing...<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  I never stole from a client, bribed a judge, or threatened a witness, and until this bum rap,  the only time I was arrested, it was a case of mistaken identity.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  How's that?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake: \tI didn't know the guy I hit was a cop.</em>  <br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"2013-09-30-StatevsLassiter400x300.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-30-StatevsLassiter400x300.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><br />\n<br />\nPaul:   Okay, at the start of the book, you're having an affair with a beautiful woman who  also happens to be your banker.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  So sue me.  Women think I look like a young Harrison Ford.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:   One keystroke, I'll turn you into an old Henry Ford.  You and your lady are having a fancy dinner on Miami Beach.  She threatens to turn you in for skimming client funds, and next thing we know, she's dead...in your hotel suite.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Is there a question in there, counselor?</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:   What happened?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  I take the Fifth.  Ever heard of it?</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You go on trial for murder.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Hold your horses.  No spoilers!</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  \"Hold your horses?\"  What are you, an extra in \"Gunsmoke?\"<br />\n<br />\nJake:  <em>Sorry if I'm not hip enough for you, scribbler.  You won't find my mug on  Facebook.  I don't have a life coach, an aroma therapist, or a yoga instructor, and I don't do Pilates.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  So you're not trendy.  You're not a Yuppie.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  I'm a carnivore among vegans, a brew and burger guy in a Chardonnay and paté world.  </em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You're a throwback, then?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  If that's what you call someone with old friends, old habits, and old values.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  Bring us up to date.  You first appeared in \"To Speak for the Dead\" in 1990. <br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Yeah, and Hollywood made a TV movie with Gerald McRaney.  My ass is better looking than him.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  Who should play you in a movie?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Easy.  The Duke.</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  John Wayne?  You're kidding.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  \"I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted, and I won't be laid a hand on.\"  Sort of sums it up, don't it? </em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  <a href=\"http://www.paul-levine.com/series/state-vs-lassiter/\" target=\"_hplink\">\"State vs. Lassiter\"</a> is your tenth book.  But you're facing life in prison.  Is this the end?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Not entirely up to me, is it scribbler?</em><br />\n<br />\nPaul:  Last question.  Do you consider yourself hard-boiled?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  (Reaches across the table and pops Paul with a left jab.  Ka-pow!).  What do you think?</em><br />\n<br />\n(More information about \"State vs. Lassiter\" and the author's other novels is available on <a href=\"http://www.paul-levine.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Paul Levine's Website</a>.)", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 14:05:41 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-levine/sam-spade-and-philip-marl_b_4017466.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-levine/sam-spade-and-philip-marl_b_4017466.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:05:41 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe -- Meet Jake Lassiter"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:55:58 UTC +00:00]]

(It is, after all, one of the foundational works of Western literature; Goethe called it and \"The Iliad\" \"the two most important books in the world.\") What surprises many readers is that it still has the power to enchant. I discovered it as a 10-year-old, after my teacher had us trace Flaxman's spear-carrying, helmet-and-negligee-clad Athena on to drawing paper. Athena was the goddess of wisdom, she told us, and while \"wisdom\" meant nothing to me at the time, I was impressed that the goddess had popped straight out of Zeus's head, in a reversed form of the virgin birth that I had first heard about the Christmas before. \"The Odyssey\" wasn't on our sixth-grade reading list, but I found a children's version in the library and plunged right in. One-eyed man-eating ogres, self-navigating ships, ghosts sipping blood at the entrance to the underworld, shipwrecks, nymphs, princesses, witches, disguises, recognitions, and, to top it all off, a wholesale slaughter of bad guys at the end! What could be more exciting?<br />\n<br />\nReading \"The Odyssey,\" we enter a world infused by the imagination. Everything becomes fresh and new; familiar objects light up with an inner radiance, as if we were seeing the sky or smelling the grass for the first time. And we are always carried along by the steady yet constantly varying rhythms of the meter, which serves as a counterpoint to even the most horrific events, so that everything we read is lifted up into the realm of the beautiful.<br />\n<br />\nNo detail is too small to escape the poet's attentive gaze, no dream image too fantastic to be made humanly accessible. The six-headed, razor-toothed, tentacled monster Scylla, for example, might easily have seemed cartoonish in the hands of a lesser poet, but she is presented to us so clearly, and her murderous attack described with such elegant precision, that she bursts into existence, as appalling as we could wish:<br />\n<br />\n\"At that very moment Scylla rushed out and snatched<br />\nsix of my comrades--beautiful, strong young men.<br />\nI looked up and saw their arms and legs thrashing above me,<br />\nand they shouted to me and called out my name for the last time.<br />\nAnd as a fisherman stands on a jutting rock<br />\nand casts the bait with his rod, and the bronze hook sinks<br />\ninto the water, sheathed in an ox-horn tube,<br />\nand he catches a fish and reels it in quickly and flings it,<br />\nwrithing, on to the shore: just so were my comrades,<br />\nwrithing, pulled up towards the cliffs, and at the cave entrance<br />\nshe ate them. They screamed and kept stretching their hands out towards me<br />\nin their hideous final agony. That was the most<br />\nsickening thing I ever saw on my travels.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd here is a picture of the Phaeacian princess Nausicäa and her handmaids washing the royal laundry. (It's a passage that shocked the sniffy classicists of later ages, who thought that doing laundry was beneath the dignity of a princess.)<br />\n<br />\nThey came at last to the banks of a beautiful stream,<br />\nwhere the washing basins were always filled with clear water<br />\nwelling up through them, to clean the dirtiest clothes.<br />\nHere they unyoked the mules from the wagon and sent them<br />\nalong the stream to graze on the rich, sweet clover,<br />\nthen lifted the clothes from the wagon and carried them down<br />\ninto the basins, and each girl began to tread them,<br />\nmaking a game to see who could finish first.<br />\nAnd when they had washed off the dirt and the clothes were spotless,<br />\nthey spread them neatly along the shore, where the sea<br />\nlapped at the land and washed all the pebbles clean.<br />\nAfter a swim, they rubbed themselves with the oil<br />\nand had their lunch on the bank of the eddying river<br />\nand waited there for the clothing to dry in the sun.<br />\nAnd when they had finished the meal, they took off their head scarves<br />\nand played a ball game, tossing the ball and dancing<br />\nto the rhythm, while Nausícäa led them in song.<br />\n<br />\nYou can find passages like these on almost every page of \"The Odyssey.\" And woven through all these gorgeous or horrific scenes is the central theme: the theme of going home, which is one reason \"The Odyssey\" has such a universal appeal. \"I know no place that is sweeter than my own country,\" Odysseus says, and that is a feeling we can all recognize. The goddess Calypso even promises Odysseus eternal life, if only he will stay with her on her idyllic island and submit to a life of constant sex and unalloyed sensual pleasure. But he refuses her offer. He longs for his home and his wife more than he cares about immortality. This is not a case of nostalgia, which is a longing for a past that can never be and perhaps never has been, and therefore necessarily ends in disappointment. He is longing not for a past but for a future, in a place that is beloved beyond all others on earth or in heaven. Penelope, his wife, was 20 when he sailed for Troy; she is 40 now, and whether or not she has kept her physical beauty is beside the point. She is a woman, not a goddess, but she is the one he loves. Odysseus's refusal of immortality is the most moving tribute that a marriage has ever received. It is like Adam's refusal in \"Paradise Lost\": when Eve offers him the fruit, Adam bites into it, fully aware of the consequences, because he loves her so deeply that he can't bear to remain in Eden without her.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Odyssey\" has been called the first novel. It's also one of the best.

Hayes and Franck Boulegue.</em><br />\n<br />\nDavid Lynch’s film and television works have often been described as expressions of \"dream logic.\" To me, as a dream researcher, that phrase opens up an intriguing line of inquiry. I take it as an invitation to consider Lynch’s works in light of current knowledge about the phenomenology of dreaming. Many questions about the nature and functions of dreaming remain unanswered, but best available evidence suggests that dreaming is not merely random neural nonsense from the brain, but is rather a creative and meaningful product of the imagination during sleep.<br />\n<br />\nThis is why the phrase \"dream logic\" is not an oxymoron. There is indeed a logic to dreaming, a logic that differs from ordinary waking thought but is neither inferior nor subservient to it—quite the opposite, perhaps. Dream logic embraces embodied instinct and cosmic self-awareness, our lowest animal desires and our highest spiritual aspirations, our darkest fears and our brightest joys. It governs a much wider range of experiences and realities than is normally recognized by waking consciousness.<br />\n<br />\nDreaming is clearly an integral aspect of human existence and a hardwired feature of healthy brain/mind functioning. But the autonomous otherness of dreaming makes it a disturbing phenomenon for many people. Dreaming is both me and not-me, and it’s the latter element that makes people uncomfortable. They don’t like the sense of an alien intelligence dwelling within their own minds. It’s an insult to the sovereignty of the waking ego, an unwanted intrusion of strange memories and unsettling emotions into their awareness. This wary, ego-protecting attitude is then confirmed when people hear prominent scientists dismissing dreams as neural garbage.<br />\n<br />\nThis attitude persists despite growing evidence against it, which is problematic be- cause it discourages people from exploring a powerful source of creative imagination that each human is born with – the capacity to dream, to imagine, to envision alternative possibilities, to discern realities beyond the boundaries of conventional waking reality. Dreaming is a human birthright, and people deserve more knowledge about their own innate potentials, not less.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Lynch’s works prove that some of the best and most compelling insights about dreaming come from artists who have the ability to connect with the alien otherness of dreaming, and channel its energies into creative expressions. The television series “Twin Peaks” (1990–91) offers an especially illuminating example of Lynch’s dream logic in action. The serial format allows him to develop an extended network of dream influences and interactions unfolding back and forth through time and across different domains of reality. The remote wilderness town of “Twin Peaks” becomes a kind of oneiric playground in which a whole community is consumed and enthralled by the logic of dreaming.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Preludes</b><br />\n<br />\nAs the Log Lady tells us in her introduction to the pilot episode (Season 1, Episode 1), the many stories of “Twin Peaks” begin with ‘the one’: Laura Palmer. Her shocking death has given birth to strange and frightening new realities for everyone who knew her. In these new realities, the boundaries between waking and dreaming have shifted in mysterious ways. Prior to Laura’s death, dreaming is treated as a light-hearted, easy-going realm of shared fantasy. In the morning before they heard about Laura, Bobby leaves the Double R Diner with a flirtatious, ‘Norma, I’ll see you in my dreams,’ and Norma smiles in response, ‘Not if I see you first.’ Another example comes later in the pilot with the ‘policeman’s dream’ at the “Twin Peaks” Sheriff’s Department – an elaborate array of colorfully glazed donuts that Lucy creates each night to greet the Sheriff and his men in the morning. These references allude to the happy, playful dimensions of dreaming.<br />\n<br />\nThen Laura’s battered corpse washes ashore, and a much darker and claustrophobic tone takes over the references to dreaming. Ronette barely survived the attack that killed Laura, and now she is trapped within her own neurologically damaged mind, unresponsive to the outside world, her eyes darting under her bruised eyelids as if she were in rapid eye movement sleep, unable to escape the nightmare reality of what happened to her and Laura.<br />\n<br />\nDonna, meanwhile, is struggling with ambivalent feelings about her newfound love with James. She learns at the beginning of Episode 3 that she had awakened her parents with her crying during the night, even though she doesn’t remember it now.  She tells her mother, ‘It’s so strange, like I’m having the most beautiful dream and most terrible nightmare all at once.’ Donna’s paradoxical sensation resonates with the integral polarity of “Twin Peaks” itself. From a rational waking viewpoint, a feeling like Donna’s makes no sense. But it does make sense within the more expansive logic of dreams.<br />\n<br />\nThe worst victim of disturbed dreaming is Laura’s mother, Sarah Palmer. At the same time of night when Laura was killed 24 hours earlier, Sarah lies on the living room couch and closes her eyes. She immediately slips into a clairvoyant dream of a gloved hand unearthing the broken heart necklace that James and Donna had just secretly buried. The pilot ends with Sarah’s echoing scream as she bolts awake in a panic. In Episode 3, Sarah’s fragile grasp on waking reality breaks entirely as she holds Donna’s hand and hallucinates the face of Laura, crying ‘My baby! My baby!’ This psychotic rupture of consciousness leads Sarah to a sudden vision of killer BOB, the ultimate nightmare villain of “Twin Peaks”, crouched at the foot of Laura’s bed. The intensity of Sarah’s traumatization has exposed her to collective nightmare forces that are loose in “Twin Peaks” and threaten everyone in the community. In the midst of her anguish and loss of sanity, she has become an unwilling prophetess.<br />\n<br />\nIn the pilot and Episode 3 we already see the kaleidoscopic themes of dream and nightmare that will pervade the series as a whole. Dreams as expressions of sexual de- sire, as prophecies, as warnings, as doorways to other realities, as traumatic symptoms, as shared fantasies – all of these themes are already in place at the beginning of the next episode, the ‘dreamiest’ of the series.<br />\n<br />\n<!--pagebreak--><br />\n<br />\n<b>Agent Cooper’s deductive technique</b><br />\n<br />\nEpisode 4 is the oneiric epicentre of “Twin Peaks”. It establishes FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, the hero of the series, as a virtuoso dreamer and master interpreter of hidden signs and occult symbols.  We already know from the pilot and Episode 3 that Agent Cooper embodies the paradox of polarity.  Authoritative, competent and supremely well-groomed, Agent Cooper is also surprisingly passionate, naïve and childlike in his appetites. He is sent to “Twin Peaks” to solve a crime that involves a crossing of borders, spanning multiple jurisdictions; his job is to catch those who transgress boundaries. In Episode 4 we discover that Agent Cooper is in fact a kind of shaman detective, who moves comfortably through many realities and receives guidance in his investigations from intuitive, extra-rational sources of information.<br />\n<br />\nThis episode begins on Sunday morning, two days after Laura’s body was found. Agent Cooper assembles the Sheriff, Deputies Hawk and Andy, and Lucy for a lesson in dream-inspired divination. After everyone has enthusiastically amplified their senses with doughnuts and coffee, Agent Cooper extends his wand-like pointer and flips the blackboard to reveal a map of Tibet. He briefly recounts the history of the Tibetan people and their spiritual plight in order to provide a context for a dream he had three years ago, which left him ‘filled with a desire to help them’. Agent Cooper goes on to say: I also awoke from the same dream realizing I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the deepest level of intuition.<br />\n<br />\nAgent Cooper goes on to demonstrate this method, which consists of standing sixty feet, six inches away from a glass bottle (the distance between a baseball pitcher’s mound and home plate), taking a rock in his hand, speaking the name of a possible suspect to the rock, then throwing it at the bottle.<br />\n<br />\nMost discussions about dreaming in “Twin Peaks” focus on Cooper’s dream at the end of Episode 3, but I believe this scene presents a much more radical challenge to the waking world status quo of the show’s audience. Agent Cooper employs a method of crime- solving that utterly defies rational analysis – or, more precisely, it extends the mind beyond rational analysis to access other modes of knowing. His deductive technique has several components that must be carefully prepared, monitored and recorded, requiring a high degree of focused, rational attention. Yet the connection between the results (breaking the bottle) and the interpretation (being involved in Laura’s death) cannot be rationally explained. Nevertheless, as the investigation unfolds over the next several episodes, it becomes clear that each of Agent Cooper’s throws at the bottle is indeed an accurate indication of that characters’ proximity to the circumstances of Laura’s death.<br />\n<br />\nIn the middle of the scene, the Sheriff takes Agent Cooper aside and asks, with obvious incredulity, ‘The idea for all this really came from a dream?’ Agent Cooper smiles broadly and replies, with serene confidence, ‘Yes.’ The power of his dream was such that he has no doubts about the trustworthiness of the technique. The Sheriff goes along with him, perhaps because he knows that something more than normal police methods will be needed to track down and capture the person who killed Laura.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Agent Cooper’s big dream</b><br />\n<br />\nAt the end of Episode 3, Agent Cooper settles into his bed in the Great Northern. What follows for the next six-and-a-half minutes is a phantasmagoric, multi-layered dream sequence that reveals in condensed symbolic form the final truth about Laura’s murder. After this, the whole story unfolds backwards: Agent Cooper’s investigation from this point forward is a re-discovery of what he has already seen in the dream, a process of rationally validating the intuitive knowledge of his dreaming insight.<br />\n<br />\nThe dream stretches and bends reality in several ways. It projects Agent Cooper 25 years into his future, when his skin has become lined and weathered. Some of the staccato images that flash into view relate to ‘day residue’ – things he saw the previous day (Laura’s dead body, the bloody cloth in the train car, the flickering light in the morgue) – while other images in the dream somehow tune into Sarah Palmer’s recent actions (going upstairs to look for Laura) and visions (BOB crouching at the foot of Laura’s bed). Agent Cooper then hears the verses of a foreboding poem, recited by a one-armed man:<br />\n<br />\n‘Through the darkness of future’s past, the magician longs to see/One chants out be- tween two worlds: “Fire walk with me.”’ Earlier, Cooper had seen MIKE, the One-Armed Man, at the hospital, and he and the Sheriff had found a piece of paper at the crime scene with those same haunting words, ‘Fire walk with me’, written in blood. In all these ways the dream gathers snippets of evidence from the first two days of the investigation and weaves them into a bigger tapestry of meaning and motivation, a tapestry Cooper’s rational waking mind is only just beginning to grasp.<br />\n<br />\nBut the dream goes far beyond merely repeating memories and scenes from the previous days – it becomes a headlong journey into the roiling depths of the collective un- conscious. Cooper finds himself cast as the magician of the poem, opening his soul to the fire and the spaces between worlds, drawn into a supernatural ritual that invokes and temporarily binds the evil spirit of Laura’s killer. Cooper gets a good look at killer BOB, who acts as if he were surprised at being summoned thus. But BOB’s violent energy cannot be contained for long, and he glares menacingly at Cooper (and the audience) and promises he will kill again.<br />\n<br />\nMany nightmares end at moments like this, when the feelings of danger and vulnerability reach an unbearable peak of intensity. But Agent Cooper does not flee from the dream world into waking. A circle of twelve candles around a small mound of dirt blows out, calming the fiery emotions, and Cooper returns to where the dream started, in a room with red curtains.<br />\n<br />\nHaving survived the threatening ordeal of a direct encounter with BOB, Agent Cooper is ready to enter an even more mysterious realm of dream reality where he encounters two strange yet benevolent beings.  One is a dwarf in a red suit, referred to in the credits as the ‘The Man from Another Place’. The other appears to be a more mature and sophisticated version of Laura Palmer, wearing an elegant black dress.  In addition to their distortions of size and identity, both characters speak to Cooper with a bizarrely unnatural cadence, as if they were talking backwards, and their physical gestures also seem strangely out of sync with ordinary human motions. At this point, Cooper is very, very far from the waking world and even from regular dreaming – and the farther he goes, the more he learns. Later in his investigation, he finds the waking world analogues for several of the details from this part of the dream (e.g. the red curtains, Laura’s cocaine use, her arms being tied back, the presence of a bird at the crime).  More importantly, Agent Cooper discovers that he has allies in the spirit world who will help him catch the murderer. He is not alone when he pursues BOB into these otherworldly realities.<br />\n<br />\nHe awakens abruptly from the dream, just at the moment when the Laura-like woman intimately whispers into his ear the name of killer. In the sudden shift from deep dreaming to waking awareness, so radical a transformation that it musses his usually impeccable hair, Agent Cooper forgets the name. Though we in the audience might feel a stab of frustration at getting so close to the killer’s identity, Cooper takes it in stride. He accepts that he does not rationally know who killed Laura. What matters more is that intuitively he does know who killed her, thanks to this profoundly revelatory dream. Now he just has to follow the clues to solve the crime.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<!--pagebreak--><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>The final nightmare</b><br />\n<br />\nThe dream references keep coming throughout the series, far more than can be mentioned in this essay, but all extending the themes originating in the pilot and Episodes 3 and 4. To note just a few examples, Agent Cooper has a brief conversation with Deputy Hawk about the ‘dream soul’ that can travel to the realm of the dead, expanding Cooper’s shamanic links beyond Tibetan Buddhism to connect with Native American spirituality; Hank tells Norma that he dreamed of her while in prison, a romantically ominous wish-fulfilment about their comfortable bed at home; Shakespeare-spouting Ben says, ‘This is such stuff as dreams are made of’, to the new girl at One-Eyed Jacks, not realizing the girl is his daughter, Audrey, thus rendering his comment an unwitting reference to a nightmare of incest; and in perhaps the most intriguing dream experienced by someone other than Agent Cooper, Major Briggs has a ‘vision of the night’, distinct from an ordinary dream, in which he finds a way to reconcile with his rebellious son, Bobby. Major Briggs is a kind of warrior-shaman himself, more Biblical than Tibetan or Native American, who receives a reassuring dream of future family prosperity, much like the patriarchs Abraham or Jacob in the Book of Genesis.<br />\n<br />\nBy all accounts, the “Twin Peaks” series did not conclude in the way David Lynch would have liked. Outside pressures forced him to a premature disclosure of Laura’s killer, and the timing of the final episode was dictated by the network’s cancellation of the series, not by the intrinsic narrative development of the story. Nevertheless, Lynch directed the last episode and crafted it to end on a decidedly nightmarish note. After Agent Cooper has gone back into the red-curtained space of his dream and surrendered his soul in an attempt to save Annie, he wakes up in his room at the Great Northern, goes into the bathroom, and cracks the mirror above the sink with his forehead. As Cooper bleeds and cackles maniacally, killer BOB does the same on the other side of the mirror.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the final scene of the whole series, and it leaves the audience with a dark and distressing uncertainty.  Has Agent Cooper finally lost to killer BOB? Is Cooper now possessed by his evil spirit? Has he gone insane? If a virtuoso of the dream realm like Cooper can’t resist BOB, what hope do the rest of us have?<br />\n<br />\nI prefer to trust Agent Cooper’s dream in Episode 3 that he will still be alive 25 years hence. BOB isn’t just possessing Cooper, Cooper is containing BOB, too. Agent Cooper has proven himself a man capable of the most remarkable integrations of polar opposi- tions, and it seems possible, at least, that he will find a way to balance the ferocious ag- gression of BOB with the mystical equipoise he has learned from the Tibetans.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Dream logic, reconsidered</b><br />\n<br />\nEvery dream-related phenomenon in the “Twin Peaks” series has some grounding in current dream research. In that sense, David Lynch has presented a ‘realistic’ vision of dreaming in all its wildly numinous diversity. Certainly if we consider “Twin Peaks” in the context of cross-cultural history and comparative religions, the dream references appear entirely recognizable. In virtually every culture around the world and through history, dreams have been regarded as a primary means of connecting with sacred, transcendent realms, and certain people have the blessing, or curse, of a special ability to travel through dreams to learn esoteric knowledge about those realms, and bring back helpful guidance for their waking communities. Agent Cooper would be a familiar and welcome figure among any indigenous community, from Australia to Africa, from Siberia to the Americas, where shamans have served as cultural dream experts.<br />\n<br />\nEven if our context of evaluation is contemporary western brain-mind science, Lynch’s portrayal of dreaming in “Twin Peaks” strongly resonates with current research. According to multiple studies using a variety of methods, dreaming is fundamentally hyper-associational, perpetually veering between order and chaos, beauty and bizarre- ness, memories of the past and anticipations of the future. Dreaming involves a wide- ranging network of neural systems that are not bound by the strictures of waking consciousness, allowing for the emergence of novel ideas and solutions to problems that have eluded the waking mind. As many researchers from Freud onwards have shown, dreaming is deeply rooted in the instinctual nature of our species and the primal emotions that unconsciously drive our thoughts and actions. Jung and many other clinicians have highlighted conflicts of binary oppositions in dreams as symptomatic of failed psychological integration, while dreams of union and coincidentia oppositorum symbolize growth, healing and the emergence of wholeness.<br />\n<br />\nEvery night we go to sleep, we enter into a truly surrealistic realm of paradox, magic and ambiguity, where we learn, as Agent Cooper has so well, that our waking reality is only made possible by a beautiful yet precarious balance of mysterious, amoral cosmic forces. The dream logic of “Twin Peaks” is the logic of all our dreams.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 13:38:52 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/david-lynch-book_n_4031355.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/david-lynch-book_n_4031355.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 17:38:52 UTC +00:00], ["title", "New Book Explores David Lynch's 'Dream Logic'"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:55:58 UTC +00:00]]

She's the author of several books, including <em>Cats on the Couch</em>, and has appeared many times on radio and TV.  Veterinarians consult her frequently.  \"Emotional problems can cause medical problems,\" Carole told me then.  \"That's why you have to treat the <em>total</em> cat.\"  She has a monthly blog, The Wilbourn Way.<br />\n<br />\nMy piece, which was about visits to cats named Byron and Ned, has just been reprinted in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Yorker-Book-Cats/dp/0679644776\" target=\"_hplink\"><em>The Big New Yorker Book of Cats.</em></a>  (Byron was being terrorized by his father, Little Guy; and Ned was mourning the death of a cat named Buster.)<br />\n<br />\nI didn't get many \"Talk\" stories into the magazine, so this was a big moment.  But it always troubled me that Lulu, the third cat Carole and I went to see, never made it into <em>The New Yorker</em>.  And Lulu had the most poignant story of all.  But the legendary Mr. Shawn,<em> New Yorker </em>editor for 36 years, dropped her from the magazine at the last minute -- because (I was later told) he wasn't comfortable with cats in heat or with the possibility that a cat might have been deliberately injured.<br />\n<br />\nSeeing Byron and Ned back in print after all this time started me thinking all over again about poor Lulu, who never got the recognition she deserved.  I dug up my original manuscript, which I guess in her honor I'd always held onto.  So now, finally, here is Lulu, as I wrote about her then:<br />\n<br />\nLulu:  Lulu, a small, sleek black cat with yellow eyes, probably five years old, lives with her person, Mardi, in a studio apartment on Jane Street.  \"I called on Carole to help Lulu overcome some of her fears,\" Mardi said.<br />\n<br />\nLulu is afraid of many things:  unexpected noises, tall men with deep voices, anything that waves over her head, teenagers, anyone in a heavy coat, laughter, closed closet doors, paper, paper bags, and, especially, oven doors.  Mardi's apartment, cheerful and cluttered, is full of plants and has posters of polar bears and gorillas.<br />\n<br />\nCarole began by spending about 15 minutes questioning Mardi, as the two women sat on facing white wicker loveseats.  Lulu was on Mardi's lap, watching her whenever she spoke.  Mardi, a tall, striking woman with large luminous eyes, is a dancer, actress, and a seamstress who designs costumes for Broadway shows.<br />\n<br />\n\"Three years ago on a cold winter afternoon,\" Mardi said softly, stroking Lulu, \"I saw a smoky gray cat, terribly thin, lying on a subway grate to keep warm.  My first thought was 'Poor child!  I hope she doesn't die.'  Both her front legs were broken.  She spent months in a cast and wouldn't even leave my bathroom.  Every day I held her in my arms for hours.  From smoky gray she turned white, and then pepper-and-salt, and only then black.  She's come a long way -- at first she was so terrified of sunlight she wouldn't go near the window.  And so frightened of the TV set, even when it was off, that for a while I had to keep it covered with a cloth.  I gradually realized that she must have been hurt on purpose.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole agreed.  \"Where does she sleep?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"With me,\" Mardi said.  \"I don't mind -- she's not a hog.  Sometimes she cries in her sleep.  I named her after the Lulu in Berg's opera.  They both had such tragic lives.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole got down on the floor and observed Lulu for about ten minutes.  She gave Lulu some catnip, but Lulu wasn't responsive.  She gave Lulu a hand-stitched red toy mouse, which Lulu knocked about.  Then Carole got up and retired to a corner to write up her diagnosis and suggested treatment.  Lulu retreated to Mardi's lap.  In about ten minutes Carole snapped her pocketbook shut, and Lulu threw her arms around Mardi's neck.  Mardi hugged her.<br />\n<br />\n\"Lulu's kittenhood was full of trauma,\" Carole said.  \"She may have had a TV set thrown at her, or been kept in a closet, or even an oven.  I think she is clearly reliving these experiences, over and over.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole took a deep breath and continued.  \"I don't think Lulu was always the angel she is now.  Far from it.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Lulu?\" Mardi said, her eyes widening.<br />\n<br />\n\"When you found her she was unspayed, which means she was in and out of heat -- probably yowling for days on end, and biting people.  Attack cats are often confined Toms and females who are experiencing constant and intense frustration.  Maybe Lulu was driving her people crazy, and they said, 'If you don't stop it, out the window you go!'\"<br />\n<br />\nMardi held Lulu closer.  \"Were you like that?  Hmm?\"  <br />\n<br />\n\"She has an abandonment complex,\" Carole went on.  \"Get a vet to prescribe anti-anxiety medication, and keep her on it for several months.  That way she won't be so thin-skinned, thinking, Oh!  a closet door!  Oh!  the oven!  Oh!  a teenager in a heavy coat!  Lulu also has the single-cat syndrome.  Another cat would be great -- cats need cat interaction.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"My place is too small,\" Mardi said.<br />\n<br />\n\"Try giving Lulu green olives and melon -- they act as aphrodisiacs.  She's been spayed, so she'll feel sexy but not frustrated.  Massage her.  Compliment her.  Leave soft music on when you're not home.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen we spoke to Mardi a few weeks later, she said she was reluctant to put Lulu on drugs.  \"I'm sure it would help,\" she said, \"but it goes against my grain.  I'll keep on massaging and complimenting her, and I guess at her own pace she'll keep on getting better and better.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat was how my \"Talk of the Town\" piece about Lulu ended.

Roach)", :description=>"The Salem witch trials of 1692 may be the best known outbreak of such a panic but they were not typical of the usual neighborhood suspicions.<br />\n<br />\nIn \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Six-Women-Salem-Accused-Accusers/dp/0306821206\" target=\"_hplink\">Six Women of Salem: the Untold Story of the Accused and Their Accusers in the Salem Witch Trials</a>\" (DaCapo Press) I focus on the tragedy through the eyes and minds of six specific individuals, real women with lives before and (for the survivors) after 1692. <br />\n<br />\nThe six are: Rebecca Nurse, Bridget Bishop, Mary English, Ann Putnam Sr., Tituba, and Mary Warren. Of these six, five were accused, three were accusers, two were hanged, one escaped. One was Salem's wealthiest woman and one owned nothing -- not even herself.<br />\n<br />\nWitchcraft, according to the laws and common assumptions of the era, was the cooperation of mortal humans with devils in order to harm others, a spiteful alliance with the forces of Evil rather than an allegiance to God. Neighborhood discord could lead to suspicions about this possibility (which might fester for years), and such suspicions could lead to accusations -- but not necessarily to a conviction.<br />\n<br />\nWhat did it take to be accused of witchcraft in colonial America? What would your odds have been if you had been there?<br />\n<br />\nGranted, the Salem panic  was unusual in the number and diversity of suspects as well as in the duration of the crises. In general, however, an assortment of characteristics could get a person accused of witchcraft, according to the 17th century British sources used by Massachusetts courts in 1692 -- Richard Bernard's \"Guide to Grand Jury Men...in Cases of Witchcraft,\" William Perkins's \"Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft,\" and John Gaule's \"Select Cases of Conscience Touching Witches and Witchcrafts\" -- and more recent studies such as John Demos's 20th century work \"Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England\" (Oxford).<br />\n<br />\nHere are nine of them.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. You are female.</strong> <br />\nAll through western history more women than men have been accused of witchcraft. It took less for a woman to be considered out of line. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. You are middle aged. </strong><br />\nAlthough suspects in 1692 ranged from Mary Bradbury in her 80s to the approximately five-year old Dorothy Good, most supposed \"witches\" were in their late 40s and 50s. Maybe other adults were resentful of a bossy mother-figure, or maybe not. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. You are related to or otherwise associated with a known suspect. </strong><br />\nAs William Perkins pointed out \"witchcraft is an art that may be learned,\" so even if you weren't a middle-aged woman you might be accused if you were friends with a suspected \"witch\" or if the neighbors had had their doubts about your mother, especially in 1692. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. You are of an English Puritan background. </strong><br />\nFor the most part, the accused came from the same majority ethnic group as the accusers. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. You are married but have few or no children. </strong><br />\nNeighbors suffering misfortune might think you were attacking their larger families from jealousy especially if you lacked kin to speak up for you. Unprotected widows were at even more of a risk. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. You are contentious and stubborn with a turbulent reputation. </strong><br />\nWhere a man might be considered forceful, a women might have been labeled as contentious. The situation would be worse if you were also at odds with your own family. After all, the Devil encourages discord. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. You have been accused of other crimes before such as theft or slander. </strong><br />\nAs John Gaule put it a \"lewd and naughty kind of life\" was just the sort of thing that attracted devils. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. You are of a relatively low social position. </strong><br />\nStatus and rank was stronger in the 17th century. Being too often dependent on the neighbors' help could cause them to resent you.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. A confessed \"witch\" accuses you of being a fellow witch. </strong><br />\nThis was a big problem in 1692 when so many suspects \"confessed\" from fear, confusion, or an attempt to curry the court's favor. These confessing accusers generally named people already under suspicion.<br />\n<br />\nThe lesson from all this? <br />\n<br />\nIn 1692 anyone might have been accused of witchcraft. But if you were a widowed middle-aged English Puritan woman with few if any living children and slim financial resources, were known for having a temper and suspected of petty crimes (whether justified or not), and were related to or friends with someone else who was suspected of witchcraft -- watch out for the neighbors.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 12:12:31 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilynne-k-roach/9-reasons-you-might-have-_b_4029745.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilynne-k-roach/9-reasons-you-might-have-_b_4029745.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 16:12:31 UTC +00:00], ["title", "9 Reasons You Might Have Been Suspected of Witchcraft in 1692"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:55:58 UTC +00:00]]

Her analysis remains shocking today.<br />\n<br />\nSubsequent research, however, has supported and extended her central thesis.  Arendt was not just right about Eichmann's banality.  She was right about what we now call the Holocaust, and more generally about the psychology of genocide.<br />\n<br />\nAdolf Eichmann was kidnapped in Argentina by Israeli agents in May 1960 and secretly flown to Israel.  There he was put on trial in April 1961, sentenced to death in December 1961, and executed in May 1962 after an unsuccessful appeal.<br />\n<br />\nRecognizing that the trial would be an international sensation, <em>The New Yorker</em> commissioned Arendt to report on it.  Her report, published in 1963 in a series of articles followed by a book, sparked a firestorm of controversy.<br />\n<br />\nEichmann was a bureaucrat assigned by Nazi Germany to address \"the Jewish question.\"  In that capacity, Arendt wrote, he was immediately \"required ... to read Theodor Herzl's <em>Der Judenstaat</em>, the famous Zionist classic, which converted Eichmann promptly and forever to Zionism.\"<br />\n<br />\nAs an expert on Jews in the late 1930s, he testified in Jerusalem, his aim was \"a mutually acceptable, mutually fair solution.\"  What the Jews needed, no less than the Germans, was \"firm soil under their feet so that they would have a place of their own, soil of their own.\"  Working closely with Jewish leaders, he sought potential homelands for a Jewish nation outside Europe.<br />\n<br />\nThus emigration was the first solution to the Jewish question.  The emigration was to be compulsory, making it a process of expulsion, but convincing Jews to go willingly served both Zionist and Nazi purposes.<br />\n<br />\nThe second solution was concentration.  As the war made it less feasible to get Jews out of Europe, they were concentrated instead in ghettos and camps.  Eichmann's job was to get them there. <br />\n<br />\nThe Final Solution was killing.  Beginning in 1942, as it became policy to transport Jews to death camps, Eichmann organized those transports.<br />\n<br />\nAnd here Arendt made her most incendiary observation.  It was not just Eichmann who collaborated with the Nazis, and not just Germans.  And it was not just anti-Semitic people and governments.  Jews also collaborated with the Nazis, and they continued to do so as Nazi policy evolved toward the Final Solution.<br />\n<br />\nIt was popular, she noted, to bemoan the fact that Jews were \"unorganized and leaderless.\"  It was true that \"the Jewish people as a whole ... possessed no territory, no government, and no army.\"  But this was not the whole truth.  \"Wherever Jews lived,\" wrote Arendt, \"there were recognized Jewish leaders, and this leadership, almost without exception, cooperated in one way or another, for one reason or another, with the Nazis\":<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>In Amsterdam as in Warsaw, in Berlin as in Budapest, Jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property, to secure money from the deportees to defray the expenses of their deportation and extermination, to keep track of vacated apartments, [and] to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on trains.</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nJews \"distributed the Yellow Star badges.\"  Jewish Councils (Judenräte) determined who would be sent to death camps, sacrificing some Jews to save others, ultimately failing to save even themselves.  <br />\n<br />\n\"To a Jew,\" Arendt wrote, \"this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story.\"  If only Jews had been less organized, she maintained, fewer would have died.<br />\n<br />\nArendt was scornful of Jewish-specific theories purporting to explain the behavior of the victims as the result of a \"ghetto mentality\" or even a \"death wish.\"  She equally rejected German-specific theories purporting to explain the behavior of the perpetrators as the result of pathological anti-Semitism.  Eichmann was not a monster and showed no evidence of anti-Semitic motivations.<br />\n<br />\n\"The trouble with Eichmann,\" concluded Arendt, \"was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal.\"  Subsequent research shows that her main thesis holds generally for the Holocaust (see especially Christopher Browning's <em>Ordinary Men</em>) and other genocides (\"<a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=edpsychpapers\" target=\"_hplink\">Us and Them: Identity and Genocide</a>\").<br />\n<br />\n\"Those in power,\" said Eichmann in Jerusalem, abused his \"obedience.\"  \"The subject of a good government is lucky, the subject of a bad government is unlucky.  I had no luck.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhat Eichmann illustrated, concluded Arendt, was \"the strange interdependence of thoughtlessness and evil.\"  In his very banality, Eichmann was the prototypical perpetrator of genocide.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 12:07:13 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/eichmann-in-jerusalem-50-_b_4026701.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/eichmann-in-jerusalem-50-_b_4026701.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 16:07:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>: 50 Years Later"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:55:58 UTC +00:00]]

We've had a long technothriller romance since then, all the way up to yesterday when I put in my Amazon pre-order for his latest -- <em>Command Decision</em>.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>So it is worth reflecting on Clancy's legacy, not only as the provider of a certain genre of entertainment, but as a testament to the power of the imagination in preparing for an uncertain future.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>I will never forget the conversation I had with a \"figure\" in the national security community who remarked that no one could have foreseen hijacked passenger jets being flown -- kamikaze-style -- into buildings. Well, Tom Clancy did. In 1994, a full 17 years before 9/11, Clancy's novel <em>Debt of Honor</em> described how a deranged commercial airline pilot plowed his plane into the Capitol building.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Or consider recent and horrific massacre at the Westfield Mall in Kenya. Again it was Clancy who in 2003 wrote <em>Teeth of the Tiger</em>, documenting in detail the gory details of multiple mall invasions -- in the United States -- by determined terrorist groups.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Truth may be stranger than fiction, but yesterday's fiction also has a habit of becoming today's facts. In the 1980's, when I did some advisory work for the strategy team at Royal Dutch Shell, I found them all immersed in William Gibson's visionary cyberpunk sci-fi masterpiece <em>Neuromancer</em>. Shell was a company obsessed with the future, given the fact that even small changes in the social and political climate could affect the price of oil and therefore their core business model. Reading science fiction for them was simply one facet in their overall approach to sense-making and \"future-proofing\" themselves.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>So, when I imagine national security strategists sitting around trying to figure out what lies around the next corner, I hope they will spend at least part of their time reading Tom Clancy and the Tom Clancys to come. I hope they will acknowledge the power of imagination and intuition that can come out in the best, and most prophetic, fiction.</p><br />\n<br />\n<em><p>John Kao is Chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation.

She says opening yourself up is one of the most powerful things you can do -- but during her appearance on <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/Oprahs-Lifeclass-Dr-Brene-Brown-on-Vulnerability--Daring-Greatly\" target=\"_hplink\">\"Oprah’s Lifeclass,\"</a>she warns that not everyone should be trusted.<br />\n<br />\n\"How do you make yourself be vulnerable with somebody you don't completely trust, like in a relationship?\" an audience member asks in the above video.<br />\n<br />\n\"You don't,\" Brown answers.<br />\n<br />\n\"Because you know what? This is it,\" she says, gesturing to her heart. \"What's under here is the most valuable thing you have.  It's the most valuable gift you give to all of us. It's the most valuable offering you have in your life and people have to earn the right see it. They have to earn the right to see it and they have to know when they're seeing it that it's an absolute honor and privilege for you to have let them in.\"<br />\n<br />\nOprah points to a similar question she and Brown received on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OprahsLifeclass\" target=\"_hplink\">Twitter</a>: \"How do you foster an environment of #vulnerability when your partner sees it as #weakness?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"If you're being vulnerable, you're opening up your heart, and the other person thinks that that's weak of you -- you are with the wrong person,\" Oprah says.                   <br />\n<br />\n\"It's an awesome filter,\" Brown agrees.<br />\n<br />\nAs an example, Brown tells a story of a time she tried to be vulnerable with one of the mothers at her daughter's school.<br />\n<br />\n\"I was talking to someone and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, last year there was a whole week where every day I gave the wrong kid the wrong lunch half the time,'\" Brown shares. \"And she looked at me and she goes, 'Oh, I don't think I've ever had that experience.'\"                                          <br />\n<br />\n\"And I was, like, off the list, baby!\" Brown says.<br />\n<br />\nThough in this case it was easy for Brown to see that this woman didn't deserve her vulnerability, she goes on to say that in other cases, it can be painful. <br />\n<br />\n\"Here's what's scary, and we should not B.S. you about this,\" Brown says. \"You start trying this on,” she says -- meaning becoming more authentic and vulnerable -- \"there will be a pushback. You're going to freak out some people. You're going to scare some people.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy showing your vulnerability to someone, Brown explains that you're asking that person to be vulnerable in return. \"The pushback will be, what are you doing? We had a deal. You keep this closed. I keep this closed. That was our deal,\" she says.<br />\n<br />\n\"This is transformational stuff,\" Brown says.<br />\n<br />\nPart two of Oprah's conversation with Brown on <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/oprahs-lifeclass.html\" target=\"_hplink\">\"Oprah's Lifeclass\"</a> airs Sunday, Oct. 6 at 9 p.m. ET on <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/own/channel_finder.html\" target=\"_hplink\">OWN</a>.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 11:05:19 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/brene-brown-trust-vulnerability-oprah_n_4022765.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/brene-brown-trust-vulnerability-oprah_n_4022765.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 15:05:19 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Brené Brown: The Most Valuable Gift You Can Give To Another Person (VIDEO)"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:55:58 UTC +00:00]]

I hope the irony won't be lost on Mr. King in the slim chance that he reads this piece. I have a theory that most writers look to those who influence them with the hope that someday (assuming their inspiration is still alive) they will have the chance to sit with the individual over a cup of coffee and chat. I am exactly halfway through <em>Dr. Sleep</em> and its magic, characters, and story reminded me that now is as good a time as ever.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Dr. Sleep - the 50% review (no spoilers)</strong><br />\nIn this sequel to <em>The Shining</em>, the reader is introduced to old characters and references to the happenings of the previous novel and the Overlook Hotel. The ability that Danny Torrance considers both a gift and a curse (also called the shining) is still present in his life. The quick introduction of the True Knot counterbalances this theme perfectly because the reader sees similarities in the shinning and the power wielded by the True Knot. The sins of the father have found their way to Danny in his drinking and once again, King relates to the human side of the supernatural in every player within the game. No matter how extravagant the moment or the work of magic, the reader is able to see the human behind it all. This is the magic of this story. As I go on to finish it in the next two days I have resigned myself to the fact that what I expect to see will probably be the last thing to happen and while that may disappoint some, it exhilarates those of us who understand that endings in real life rarely meet our expectations. There are other<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/stephen-king-boulder_n_3997238.html\" target=\"_hplink\"> reviews</a> out there which give this story more credit than I (given I haven't finished it yet), so go to those for further information. As a fan and the before mentioned \"inspired\", there are other things to say.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>As a Fan</strong><br />\nStephen King has the uncanny ability to link the supernatural with the human element, bridging the gap between the intangible and the touch of everyday life. The first King work I ever read was <em>The Gunslinger</em>. As a cowboy fanatic who favored Clint Eastwood's version, I related to the character immediately. After reading the Dark Tower saga, I went to <em>Salem's Lot</em>, then <em>The Stand</em>, and then <em>IT</em>. The list went on from most of his novels to his many short stories. Among the uncountable connections between his vast array of work, one stands out that supersedes subject matter and setting, the creation of the character. King can create a character so real it's as though he or she is sitting across from you. You know just who they are. You've seen them in your travels and talked with them in your home. You may even have them in your family. If fiction is the truth inside the lie, then King's characters are the truest voices of all and the creation of them is something that every writer, young and old, can learn from. As a fan of your work Mr. King, I thank you for crafting stories that exist not just in nightmare, but in dreams themselves.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>As a Writer</strong><br />\nWhen I started writing seriously, the fear of the task was overwhelming, partly because I didn't know where to start and partly because I knew that I would never measure up to the literary titans of the writing world. I set page goals, took writing classes while in college, and did my best to read every book on the craft while writing every storyline that came into my head. I assume most fledglings have the same issue and encounter the same problems. For me, the book <em>On Writing</em> changed the game. It showed a methodical process that incorporated simple goal setting like daily word counts and focal points for improvement (grammar, etc.). Little nuggets of wisdom like \"you are a talented writer if you use money from a story to pay your utility bill\" reminds the reader that goals can be simple and applicable to real life rather than the fever dreams often associated with the craft.  The result is a writer who takes what they see translates it for everyone else. Again, there is magic and that magic is attainable for anyone brave enough to dedicate themselves to the worthy cause. For writers, Mr. King shows the requirements of the craft and mandates that those willing to undertake the task to do so with prudence and dedication. No frills; no grand receptions. Just an empty room, an empty page, and the difficult task of telling a story. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEvery story begins as a premonition perceived on the far side of dream. Writers seek to go to that place and through words, show everyone what they see. Stephen King has perceived enough dreams to demonstrate that it's not just possible, but repeatable. As a writer, Mr. King's influence on my development has been foundational. He has shown that story exists everywhere, from the traumatic moments in life to those times when things are seemingly mundane. That turn of eye, the hooded man at the counter, the dark truck stop on the side of the highway, and the rusty drain can all have a tale as translated by the human experience. For this, and for reasons uncountable, I say a very sincere thank you to the man who continually shows us that the magic exists.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 14:47:56 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-parker/to-stephen-king-a-thank-y_b_4026979.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-parker/to-stephen-king-a-thank-y_b_4026979.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:47:56 UTC +00:00], ["title", "To Stephen King: A Thank You"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:58:35 UTC +00:00]]

Qais Akbar Omar is one of the people with a compelling story, and his book, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers: An Afghan Family Story</em>, is gripping.  The backdrop of his story -- indeed much of the Afghan story itself -- is well-known.  It encompasses war and conflict, devastation, daily indignity, as well as survival and overcoming immense difficulty.   <br />\n<br />\nIn his first book, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers</em>, Omar recounts his experiences and the experiences of his extended family trying to survive the events of Afghanistan's last several decades.  While the book alludes to \"the time before the fighting\" the book is about the time after the fighting started.  During time period of the book, the author grows up.  These are tough years to say the least, beginning with the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and ending with the fall of the Taliban. This frank and at times horrifying book chronicles the impact of these years of upheaval on Omar and numerous members of his family. Through his story, you feel the magnitude of the impact on so many others.  <br />\n<br />\nYou are also confronted with the specter of death, either at the hands of the forces fighting in Afghanistan, warlords or the Taliban, or the deaths that occur because the years of war have ripped apart the infrastructure of daily life.  But you also see that despite that backdrop, Afghans strive to do the best they can to support their families and survive for an undetermined and undefined future.<br />\n<br />\nI recently returned to the U.S. after working for 13 months in Kabul.   And because of that, I have read dozens of books about Afghanistan.  This book is different.  It is a riveting and heart-breaking story told through the eyes of a boy, who over course of the book grows into a young man.  Unlike most other authors of memoirs or novels, Omar did not leave Afghanistan during these years (I note not for a lack of his family's attempts to do so).  He tries hard to understand the ravages of war, and the confusion about who these people are who are ripping his life apart.  He mourns his missed opportunities, and the opportunities that are not what he thought they would be, such as his studies at Kabul University during the Taliban.  His father's drive to protect his family from the conflict is nothing short of heroic, and the stories of travel to Mazar and living in the Bamiyan caves are incredible stories of what people will do to survive.<br />\n<br />\nMost compelling are the chapters about the Taliban years, with brutal tales of how men and boys were impacted by the Taliban and its drive to impose a draconian world view.  We read so much about the Taliban's impact on girls and women, but this story illuminates the very real impact on boys and men.  I found the description of Omar being stopped by a Talib to measure his armpit hair one of the most chilling vignettes I have ever read.  Omar is a good narrator; but I must admit at times, I found it hard to read more than a few pages.  I knew the general outcome of the story, but the details were often overwhelming.  <br />\n<br />\nWhether you've read other books about Afghanistan, or not, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers</em> is worth your time.  It documents a riveting and chaotic time, and gives you a sense of what it was like to be there.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 15:03:40 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephenie-foster/a-fort-of-nine-towers-an-_b_4029478.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephenie-foster/a-fort-of-nine-towers-an-_b_4029478.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:03:40 UTC +00:00], ["title", "<em>A Fort of Nine Towers: An Afghan Family Story</em>"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:09:56 UTC +00:00]]

Qais Akbar Omar is one of the people with a compelling story, and his book, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers: An Afghan Family Story</em>, is gripping.  The backdrop of his story -- indeed much of the Afghan story itself -- is well-known.  It encompasses war and conflict, devastation, daily indignity, as well as survival and overcoming immense difficulty.   <br />\n<br />\nIn his first book, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers</em>, Omar recounts his experiences and the experiences of his extended family trying to survive the events of Afghanistan's last several decades.  While the book alludes to \"the time before the fighting\" the book is about the time after the fighting started.  During time period of the book, the author grows up.  These are tough years to say the least, beginning with the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and ending with the fall of the Taliban. This frank and at times horrifying book chronicles the impact of these years of upheaval on Omar and numerous members of his family. Through his story, you feel the magnitude of the impact on so many others.  <br />\n<br />\nYou are also confronted with the specter of death, either at the hands of the forces fighting in Afghanistan, warlords or the Taliban, or the deaths that occur because the years of war have ripped apart the infrastructure of daily life.  But you also see that despite that backdrop, Afghans strive to do the best they can to support their families and survive for an undetermined and undefined future.<br />\n<br />\nI recently returned to the U.S. after working for 13 months in Kabul.   And because of that, I have read dozens of books about Afghanistan.  This book is different.  It is a riveting and heart-breaking story told through the eyes of a boy, who over course of the book grows into a young man.  Unlike most other authors of memoirs or novels, Omar did not leave Afghanistan during these years (I note not for a lack of his family's attempts to do so).  He tries hard to understand the ravages of war, and the confusion about who these people are who are ripping his life apart.  He mourns his missed opportunities, and the opportunities that are not what he thought they would be, such as his studies at Kabul University during the Taliban.  His father's drive to protect his family from the conflict is nothing short of heroic, and the stories of travel to Mazar and living in the Bamiyan caves are incredible stories of what people will do to survive.<br />\n<br />\nMost compelling are the chapters about the Taliban years, with brutal tales of how men and boys were impacted by the Taliban and its drive to impose a draconian world view.  We read so much about the Taliban's impact on girls and women, but this story illuminates the very real impact on boys and men.  I found the description of Omar being stopped by a Talib to measure his armpit hair one of the most chilling vignettes I have ever read.  Omar is a good narrator; but I must admit at times, I found it hard to read more than a few pages.  I knew the general outcome of the story, but the details were often overwhelming.  <br />\n<br />\nWhether you've read other books about Afghanistan, or not, <em>A Fort of Nine Towers</em> is worth your time.  It documents a riveting and chaotic time, and gives you a sense of what it was like to be there.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 15:03:40 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephenie-foster/a-fort-of-nine-towers-an-_b_4029478.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephenie-foster/a-fort-of-nine-towers-an-_b_4029478.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:03:40 UTC +00:00], ["title", "<em>A Fort of Nine Towers: An Afghan Family Story</em>"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]

I hope the irony won't be lost on Mr. King in the slim chance that he reads this piece. I have a theory that most writers look to those who influence them with the hope that someday (assuming their inspiration is still alive) they will have the chance to sit with the individual over a cup of coffee and chat. I am exactly halfway through <em>Dr. Sleep</em> and its magic, characters, and story reminded me that now is as good a time as ever.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Dr. Sleep - the 50% review (no spoilers)</strong><br />\nIn this sequel to <em>The Shining</em>, the reader is introduced to old characters and references to the happenings of the previous novel and the Overlook Hotel. The ability that Danny Torrance considers both a gift and a curse (also called the shining) is still present in his life. The quick introduction of the True Knot counterbalances this theme perfectly because the reader sees similarities in the shinning and the power wielded by the True Knot. The sins of the father have found their way to Danny in his drinking and once again, King relates to the human side of the supernatural in every player within the game. No matter how extravagant the moment or the work of magic, the reader is able to see the human behind it all. This is the magic of this story. As I go on to finish it in the next two days I have resigned myself to the fact that what I expect to see will probably be the last thing to happen and while that may disappoint some, it exhilarates those of us who understand that endings in real life rarely meet our expectations. There are other<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/stephen-king-boulder_n_3997238.html\" target=\"_hplink\"> reviews</a> out there which give this story more credit than I (given I haven't finished it yet), so go to those for further information. As a fan and the before mentioned \"inspired\", there are other things to say.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>As a Fan</strong><br />\nStephen King has the uncanny ability to link the supernatural with the human element, bridging the gap between the intangible and the touch of everyday life. The first King work I ever read was <em>The Gunslinger</em>. As a cowboy fanatic who favored Clint Eastwood's version, I related to the character immediately. After reading the Dark Tower saga, I went to <em>Salem's Lot</em>, then <em>The Stand</em>, and then <em>IT</em>. The list went on from most of his novels to his many short stories. Among the uncountable connections between his vast array of work, one stands out that supersedes subject matter and setting, the creation of the character. King can create a character so real it's as though he or she is sitting across from you. You know just who they are. You've seen them in your travels and talked with them in your home. You may even have them in your family. If fiction is the truth inside the lie, then King's characters are the truest voices of all and the creation of them is something that every writer, young and old, can learn from. As a fan of your work Mr. King, I thank you for crafting stories that exist not just in nightmare, but in dreams themselves.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>As a Writer</strong><br />\nWhen I started writing seriously, the fear of the task was overwhelming, partly because I didn't know where to start and partly because I knew that I would never measure up to the literary titans of the writing world. I set page goals, took writing classes while in college, and did my best to read every book on the craft while writing every storyline that came into my head. I assume most fledglings have the same issue and encounter the same problems. For me, the book <em>On Writing</em> changed the game. It showed a methodical process that incorporated simple goal setting like daily word counts and focal points for improvement (grammar, etc.). Little nuggets of wisdom like \"you are a talented writer if you use money from a story to pay your utility bill\" reminds the reader that goals can be simple and applicable to real life rather than the fever dreams often associated with the craft.  The result is a writer who takes what they see translates it for everyone else. Again, there is magic and that magic is attainable for anyone brave enough to dedicate themselves to the worthy cause. For writers, Mr. King shows the requirements of the craft and mandates that those willing to undertake the task to do so with prudence and dedication. No frills; no grand receptions. Just an empty room, an empty page, and the difficult task of telling a story. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEvery story begins as a premonition perceived on the far side of dream. Writers seek to go to that place and through words, show everyone what they see. Stephen King has perceived enough dreams to demonstrate that it's not just possible, but repeatable. As a writer, Mr. King's influence on my development has been foundational. He has shown that story exists everywhere, from the traumatic moments in life to those times when things are seemingly mundane. That turn of eye, the hooded man at the counter, the dark truck stop on the side of the highway, and the rusty drain can all have a tale as translated by the human experience. For this, and for reasons uncountable, I say a very sincere thank you to the man who continually shows us that the magic exists.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 14:47:56 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-parker/to-stephen-king-a-thank-y_b_4026979.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-parker/to-stephen-king-a-thank-y_b_4026979.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 18:47:56 UTC +00:00], ["title", "To Stephen King: A Thank You"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]

Raymond Chandler's<strong> Philip Marlowe </strong>and Mickey Spillane's<strong> Mike Hammer </strong>were among the answers.  So, too, of course was Dashiell Hammett's <strong>Sam Spade</strong>.  How could he not be with lines like this from \"The Maltese Falcon?\"<br />\n<br />\n<em>\"When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it.  It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him.\"</em>  <img alt=\"2013-09-30-TheMalteseFalconthumb560xauto26104.gif\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-30-TheMalteseFalconthumb560xauto26104.gif\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\" /><br />\n<br />\nMore contemporary tough guys like <strong>Dave Robicheaux </strong>from James Lee Burke's novels, <strong>Matt Scudder </strong>from Lawrence Block and <strong>Easy Rawlins </strong>from Walter Mosley were also on the list.  So, too, were<strong> Spenser </strong>and <strong>Travis McGee</strong>.  I think those two iconic tough guys display a tad too much sentimentality to be considered old-school hard-boiled, but no one can deny that Robert B. Parker and John D. MacDonald created protagonists who will live forever.  The occasional female character also cropped up.  <strong>Lisbeth Salander</strong>, from Stieg Larsson's \"The Girl...\" series, made an appearance, as did Sara Peretsky's <strong>V.I. Warshawski</strong>.<br />\n<br />\nBut the name that blindsided me was <strong>Jake Lassiter</strong>, the linebacker-turned-lawyer in 10 of <em>my</em> novels, including the recently released \"State vs. Lassiter.\"<br />\n<br />\nFunny thing is, just as with Spenser and Travis McGee, Jake never seemed that hard-boiled to me.  Oh, there's the occasional tough-guy line: \"They don't call us sharks for our ability to swim.\"  <br />\n<br />\nThen there's his comment about the sign to be found in every Miami courtroom: \"We Who Labor Here Seek Only Truth.\"  Jake's rejoinder: \"Subject to the truth being concealed by lying witnesses, distorted by sleazy lawyers, and excluded by inept judges.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut is that enough?  To determine whether Jake is hard-boiled or merely cynical, I recently had a not-too-friendly conversation with him:<br />\n<br />\nPaul:  You look like you're still in shape to play for the Miami Dolphins.  How do you do it?<br />\n<br />\n<em>Jake:  Being fictional helps.

(It is, after all, one of the foundational works of Western literature; Goethe called it and \"The Iliad\" \"the two most important books in the world.\") What surprises many readers is that it still has the power to enchant. I discovered it as a 10-year-old, after my teacher had us trace Flaxman's spear-carrying, helmet-and-negligee-clad Athena on to drawing paper. Athena was the goddess of wisdom, she told us, and while \"wisdom\" meant nothing to me at the time, I was impressed that the goddess had popped straight out of Zeus's head, in a reversed form of the virgin birth that I had first heard about the Christmas before. \"The Odyssey\" wasn't on our sixth-grade reading list, but I found a children's version in the library and plunged right in. One-eyed man-eating ogres, self-navigating ships, ghosts sipping blood at the entrance to the underworld, shipwrecks, nymphs, princesses, witches, disguises, recognitions, and, to top it all off, a wholesale slaughter of bad guys at the end! What could be more exciting?<br />\n<br />\nReading \"The Odyssey,\" we enter a world infused by the imagination. Everything becomes fresh and new; familiar objects light up with an inner radiance, as if we were seeing the sky or smelling the grass for the first time. And we are always carried along by the steady yet constantly varying rhythms of the meter, which serves as a counterpoint to even the most horrific events, so that everything we read is lifted up into the realm of the beautiful.<br />\n<br />\nNo detail is too small to escape the poet's attentive gaze, no dream image too fantastic to be made humanly accessible. The six-headed, razor-toothed, tentacled monster Scylla, for example, might easily have seemed cartoonish in the hands of a lesser poet, but she is presented to us so clearly, and her murderous attack described with such elegant precision, that she bursts into existence, as appalling as we could wish:<br />\n<br />\n\"At that very moment Scylla rushed out and snatched<br />\nsix of my comrades--beautiful, strong young men.<br />\nI looked up and saw their arms and legs thrashing above me,<br />\nand they shouted to me and called out my name for the last time.<br />\nAnd as a fisherman stands on a jutting rock<br />\nand casts the bait with his rod, and the bronze hook sinks<br />\ninto the water, sheathed in an ox-horn tube,<br />\nand he catches a fish and reels it in quickly and flings it,<br />\nwrithing, on to the shore: just so were my comrades,<br />\nwrithing, pulled up towards the cliffs, and at the cave entrance<br />\nshe ate them. They screamed and kept stretching their hands out towards me<br />\nin their hideous final agony. That was the most<br />\nsickening thing I ever saw on my travels.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd here is a picture of the Phaeacian princess Nausicäa and her handmaids washing the royal laundry. (It's a passage that shocked the sniffy classicists of later ages, who thought that doing laundry was beneath the dignity of a princess.)<br />\n<br />\nThey came at last to the banks of a beautiful stream,<br />\nwhere the washing basins were always filled with clear water<br />\nwelling up through them, to clean the dirtiest clothes.<br />\nHere they unyoked the mules from the wagon and sent them<br />\nalong the stream to graze on the rich, sweet clover,<br />\nthen lifted the clothes from the wagon and carried them down<br />\ninto the basins, and each girl began to tread them,<br />\nmaking a game to see who could finish first.<br />\nAnd when they had washed off the dirt and the clothes were spotless,<br />\nthey spread them neatly along the shore, where the sea<br />\nlapped at the land and washed all the pebbles clean.<br />\nAfter a swim, they rubbed themselves with the oil<br />\nand had their lunch on the bank of the eddying river<br />\nand waited there for the clothing to dry in the sun.<br />\nAnd when they had finished the meal, they took off their head scarves<br />\nand played a ball game, tossing the ball and dancing<br />\nto the rhythm, while Nausícäa led them in song.<br />\n<br />\nYou can find passages like these on almost every page of \"The Odyssey.\" And woven through all these gorgeous or horrific scenes is the central theme: the theme of going home, which is one reason \"The Odyssey\" has such a universal appeal. \"I know no place that is sweeter than my own country,\" Odysseus says, and that is a feeling we can all recognize. The goddess Calypso even promises Odysseus eternal life, if only he will stay with her on her idyllic island and submit to a life of constant sex and unalloyed sensual pleasure. But he refuses her offer. He longs for his home and his wife more than he cares about immortality. This is not a case of nostalgia, which is a longing for a past that can never be and perhaps never has been, and therefore necessarily ends in disappointment. He is longing not for a past but for a future, in a place that is beloved beyond all others on earth or in heaven. Penelope, his wife, was 20 when he sailed for Troy; she is 40 now, and whether or not she has kept her physical beauty is beside the point. She is a woman, not a goddess, but she is the one he loves. Odysseus's refusal of immortality is the most moving tribute that a marriage has ever received. It is like Adam's refusal in \"Paradise Lost\": when Eve offers him the fruit, Adam bites into it, fully aware of the consequences, because he loves her so deeply that he can't bear to remain in Eden without her.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Odyssey\" has been called the first novel. It's also one of the best.

Hayes and Franck Boulegue.</em><br />\n<br />\nDavid Lynch’s film and television works have often been described as expressions of \"dream logic.\" To me, as a dream researcher, that phrase opens up an intriguing line of inquiry. I take it as an invitation to consider Lynch’s works in light of current knowledge about the phenomenology of dreaming. Many questions about the nature and functions of dreaming remain unanswered, but best available evidence suggests that dreaming is not merely random neural nonsense from the brain, but is rather a creative and meaningful product of the imagination during sleep.<br />\n<br />\nThis is why the phrase \"dream logic\" is not an oxymoron. There is indeed a logic to dreaming, a logic that differs from ordinary waking thought but is neither inferior nor subservient to it—quite the opposite, perhaps. Dream logic embraces embodied instinct and cosmic self-awareness, our lowest animal desires and our highest spiritual aspirations, our darkest fears and our brightest joys. It governs a much wider range of experiences and realities than is normally recognized by waking consciousness.<br />\n<br />\nDreaming is clearly an integral aspect of human existence and a hardwired feature of healthy brain/mind functioning. But the autonomous otherness of dreaming makes it a disturbing phenomenon for many people. Dreaming is both me and not-me, and it’s the latter element that makes people uncomfortable. They don’t like the sense of an alien intelligence dwelling within their own minds. It’s an insult to the sovereignty of the waking ego, an unwanted intrusion of strange memories and unsettling emotions into their awareness. This wary, ego-protecting attitude is then confirmed when people hear prominent scientists dismissing dreams as neural garbage.<br />\n<br />\nThis attitude persists despite growing evidence against it, which is problematic be- cause it discourages people from exploring a powerful source of creative imagination that each human is born with – the capacity to dream, to imagine, to envision alternative possibilities, to discern realities beyond the boundaries of conventional waking reality. Dreaming is a human birthright, and people deserve more knowledge about their own innate potentials, not less.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Lynch’s works prove that some of the best and most compelling insights about dreaming come from artists who have the ability to connect with the alien otherness of dreaming, and channel its energies into creative expressions. The television series “Twin Peaks” (1990–91) offers an especially illuminating example of Lynch’s dream logic in action. The serial format allows him to develop an extended network of dream influences and interactions unfolding back and forth through time and across different domains of reality. The remote wilderness town of “Twin Peaks” becomes a kind of oneiric playground in which a whole community is consumed and enthralled by the logic of dreaming.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Preludes</b><br />\n<br />\nAs the Log Lady tells us in her introduction to the pilot episode (Season 1, Episode 1), the many stories of “Twin Peaks” begin with ‘the one’: Laura Palmer. Her shocking death has given birth to strange and frightening new realities for everyone who knew her. In these new realities, the boundaries between waking and dreaming have shifted in mysterious ways. Prior to Laura’s death, dreaming is treated as a light-hearted, easy-going realm of shared fantasy. In the morning before they heard about Laura, Bobby leaves the Double R Diner with a flirtatious, ‘Norma, I’ll see you in my dreams,’ and Norma smiles in response, ‘Not if I see you first.’ Another example comes later in the pilot with the ‘policeman’s dream’ at the “Twin Peaks” Sheriff’s Department – an elaborate array of colorfully glazed donuts that Lucy creates each night to greet the Sheriff and his men in the morning. These references allude to the happy, playful dimensions of dreaming.<br />\n<br />\nThen Laura’s battered corpse washes ashore, and a much darker and claustrophobic tone takes over the references to dreaming. Ronette barely survived the attack that killed Laura, and now she is trapped within her own neurologically damaged mind, unresponsive to the outside world, her eyes darting under her bruised eyelids as if she were in rapid eye movement sleep, unable to escape the nightmare reality of what happened to her and Laura.<br />\n<br />\nDonna, meanwhile, is struggling with ambivalent feelings about her newfound love with James. She learns at the beginning of Episode 3 that she had awakened her parents with her crying during the night, even though she doesn’t remember it now.  She tells her mother, ‘It’s so strange, like I’m having the most beautiful dream and most terrible nightmare all at once.’ Donna’s paradoxical sensation resonates with the integral polarity of “Twin Peaks” itself. From a rational waking viewpoint, a feeling like Donna’s makes no sense. But it does make sense within the more expansive logic of dreams.<br />\n<br />\nThe worst victim of disturbed dreaming is Laura’s mother, Sarah Palmer. At the same time of night when Laura was killed 24 hours earlier, Sarah lies on the living room couch and closes her eyes. She immediately slips into a clairvoyant dream of a gloved hand unearthing the broken heart necklace that James and Donna had just secretly buried. The pilot ends with Sarah’s echoing scream as she bolts awake in a panic. In Episode 3, Sarah’s fragile grasp on waking reality breaks entirely as she holds Donna’s hand and hallucinates the face of Laura, crying ‘My baby! My baby!’ This psychotic rupture of consciousness leads Sarah to a sudden vision of killer BOB, the ultimate nightmare villain of “Twin Peaks”, crouched at the foot of Laura’s bed. The intensity of Sarah’s traumatization has exposed her to collective nightmare forces that are loose in “Twin Peaks” and threaten everyone in the community. In the midst of her anguish and loss of sanity, she has become an unwilling prophetess.<br />\n<br />\nIn the pilot and Episode 3 we already see the kaleidoscopic themes of dream and nightmare that will pervade the series as a whole. Dreams as expressions of sexual de- sire, as prophecies, as warnings, as doorways to other realities, as traumatic symptoms, as shared fantasies – all of these themes are already in place at the beginning of the next episode, the ‘dreamiest’ of the series.<br />\n<br />\n<!--pagebreak--><br />\n<br />\n<b>Agent Cooper’s deductive technique</b><br />\n<br />\nEpisode 4 is the oneiric epicentre of “Twin Peaks”. It establishes FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, the hero of the series, as a virtuoso dreamer and master interpreter of hidden signs and occult symbols.  We already know from the pilot and Episode 3 that Agent Cooper embodies the paradox of polarity.  Authoritative, competent and supremely well-groomed, Agent Cooper is also surprisingly passionate, naïve and childlike in his appetites. He is sent to “Twin Peaks” to solve a crime that involves a crossing of borders, spanning multiple jurisdictions; his job is to catch those who transgress boundaries. In Episode 4 we discover that Agent Cooper is in fact a kind of shaman detective, who moves comfortably through many realities and receives guidance in his investigations from intuitive, extra-rational sources of information.<br />\n<br />\nThis episode begins on Sunday morning, two days after Laura’s body was found. Agent Cooper assembles the Sheriff, Deputies Hawk and Andy, and Lucy for a lesson in dream-inspired divination. After everyone has enthusiastically amplified their senses with doughnuts and coffee, Agent Cooper extends his wand-like pointer and flips the blackboard to reveal a map of Tibet. He briefly recounts the history of the Tibetan people and their spiritual plight in order to provide a context for a dream he had three years ago, which left him ‘filled with a desire to help them’. Agent Cooper goes on to say: I also awoke from the same dream realizing I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the deepest level of intuition.<br />\n<br />\nAgent Cooper goes on to demonstrate this method, which consists of standing sixty feet, six inches away from a glass bottle (the distance between a baseball pitcher’s mound and home plate), taking a rock in his hand, speaking the name of a possible suspect to the rock, then throwing it at the bottle.<br />\n<br />\nMost discussions about dreaming in “Twin Peaks” focus on Cooper’s dream at the end of Episode 3, but I believe this scene presents a much more radical challenge to the waking world status quo of the show’s audience. Agent Cooper employs a method of crime- solving that utterly defies rational analysis – or, more precisely, it extends the mind beyond rational analysis to access other modes of knowing. His deductive technique has several components that must be carefully prepared, monitored and recorded, requiring a high degree of focused, rational attention. Yet the connection between the results (breaking the bottle) and the interpretation (being involved in Laura’s death) cannot be rationally explained. Nevertheless, as the investigation unfolds over the next several episodes, it becomes clear that each of Agent Cooper’s throws at the bottle is indeed an accurate indication of that characters’ proximity to the circumstances of Laura’s death.<br />\n<br />\nIn the middle of the scene, the Sheriff takes Agent Cooper aside and asks, with obvious incredulity, ‘The idea for all this really came from a dream?’ Agent Cooper smiles broadly and replies, with serene confidence, ‘Yes.’ The power of his dream was such that he has no doubts about the trustworthiness of the technique. The Sheriff goes along with him, perhaps because he knows that something more than normal police methods will be needed to track down and capture the person who killed Laura.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Agent Cooper’s big dream</b><br />\n<br />\nAt the end of Episode 3, Agent Cooper settles into his bed in the Great Northern. What follows for the next six-and-a-half minutes is a phantasmagoric, multi-layered dream sequence that reveals in condensed symbolic form the final truth about Laura’s murder. After this, the whole story unfolds backwards: Agent Cooper’s investigation from this point forward is a re-discovery of what he has already seen in the dream, a process of rationally validating the intuitive knowledge of his dreaming insight.<br />\n<br />\nThe dream stretches and bends reality in several ways. It projects Agent Cooper 25 years into his future, when his skin has become lined and weathered. Some of the staccato images that flash into view relate to ‘day residue’ – things he saw the previous day (Laura’s dead body, the bloody cloth in the train car, the flickering light in the morgue) – while other images in the dream somehow tune into Sarah Palmer’s recent actions (going upstairs to look for Laura) and visions (BOB crouching at the foot of Laura’s bed). Agent Cooper then hears the verses of a foreboding poem, recited by a one-armed man:<br />\n<br />\n‘Through the darkness of future’s past, the magician longs to see/One chants out be- tween two worlds: “Fire walk with me.”’ Earlier, Cooper had seen MIKE, the One-Armed Man, at the hospital, and he and the Sheriff had found a piece of paper at the crime scene with those same haunting words, ‘Fire walk with me’, written in blood. In all these ways the dream gathers snippets of evidence from the first two days of the investigation and weaves them into a bigger tapestry of meaning and motivation, a tapestry Cooper’s rational waking mind is only just beginning to grasp.<br />\n<br />\nBut the dream goes far beyond merely repeating memories and scenes from the previous days – it becomes a headlong journey into the roiling depths of the collective un- conscious. Cooper finds himself cast as the magician of the poem, opening his soul to the fire and the spaces between worlds, drawn into a supernatural ritual that invokes and temporarily binds the evil spirit of Laura’s killer. Cooper gets a good look at killer BOB, who acts as if he were surprised at being summoned thus. But BOB’s violent energy cannot be contained for long, and he glares menacingly at Cooper (and the audience) and promises he will kill again.<br />\n<br />\nMany nightmares end at moments like this, when the feelings of danger and vulnerability reach an unbearable peak of intensity. But Agent Cooper does not flee from the dream world into waking. A circle of twelve candles around a small mound of dirt blows out, calming the fiery emotions, and Cooper returns to where the dream started, in a room with red curtains.<br />\n<br />\nHaving survived the threatening ordeal of a direct encounter with BOB, Agent Cooper is ready to enter an even more mysterious realm of dream reality where he encounters two strange yet benevolent beings.  One is a dwarf in a red suit, referred to in the credits as the ‘The Man from Another Place’. The other appears to be a more mature and sophisticated version of Laura Palmer, wearing an elegant black dress.  In addition to their distortions of size and identity, both characters speak to Cooper with a bizarrely unnatural cadence, as if they were talking backwards, and their physical gestures also seem strangely out of sync with ordinary human motions. At this point, Cooper is very, very far from the waking world and even from regular dreaming – and the farther he goes, the more he learns. Later in his investigation, he finds the waking world analogues for several of the details from this part of the dream (e.g. the red curtains, Laura’s cocaine use, her arms being tied back, the presence of a bird at the crime).  More importantly, Agent Cooper discovers that he has allies in the spirit world who will help him catch the murderer. He is not alone when he pursues BOB into these otherworldly realities.<br />\n<br />\nHe awakens abruptly from the dream, just at the moment when the Laura-like woman intimately whispers into his ear the name of killer. In the sudden shift from deep dreaming to waking awareness, so radical a transformation that it musses his usually impeccable hair, Agent Cooper forgets the name. Though we in the audience might feel a stab of frustration at getting so close to the killer’s identity, Cooper takes it in stride. He accepts that he does not rationally know who killed Laura. What matters more is that intuitively he does know who killed her, thanks to this profoundly revelatory dream. Now he just has to follow the clues to solve the crime.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<!--pagebreak--><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>The final nightmare</b><br />\n<br />\nThe dream references keep coming throughout the series, far more than can be mentioned in this essay, but all extending the themes originating in the pilot and Episodes 3 and 4. To note just a few examples, Agent Cooper has a brief conversation with Deputy Hawk about the ‘dream soul’ that can travel to the realm of the dead, expanding Cooper’s shamanic links beyond Tibetan Buddhism to connect with Native American spirituality; Hank tells Norma that he dreamed of her while in prison, a romantically ominous wish-fulfilment about their comfortable bed at home; Shakespeare-spouting Ben says, ‘This is such stuff as dreams are made of’, to the new girl at One-Eyed Jacks, not realizing the girl is his daughter, Audrey, thus rendering his comment an unwitting reference to a nightmare of incest; and in perhaps the most intriguing dream experienced by someone other than Agent Cooper, Major Briggs has a ‘vision of the night’, distinct from an ordinary dream, in which he finds a way to reconcile with his rebellious son, Bobby. Major Briggs is a kind of warrior-shaman himself, more Biblical than Tibetan or Native American, who receives a reassuring dream of future family prosperity, much like the patriarchs Abraham or Jacob in the Book of Genesis.<br />\n<br />\nBy all accounts, the “Twin Peaks” series did not conclude in the way David Lynch would have liked. Outside pressures forced him to a premature disclosure of Laura’s killer, and the timing of the final episode was dictated by the network’s cancellation of the series, not by the intrinsic narrative development of the story. Nevertheless, Lynch directed the last episode and crafted it to end on a decidedly nightmarish note. After Agent Cooper has gone back into the red-curtained space of his dream and surrendered his soul in an attempt to save Annie, he wakes up in his room at the Great Northern, goes into the bathroom, and cracks the mirror above the sink with his forehead. As Cooper bleeds and cackles maniacally, killer BOB does the same on the other side of the mirror.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the final scene of the whole series, and it leaves the audience with a dark and distressing uncertainty.  Has Agent Cooper finally lost to killer BOB? Is Cooper now possessed by his evil spirit? Has he gone insane? If a virtuoso of the dream realm like Cooper can’t resist BOB, what hope do the rest of us have?<br />\n<br />\nI prefer to trust Agent Cooper’s dream in Episode 3 that he will still be alive 25 years hence. BOB isn’t just possessing Cooper, Cooper is containing BOB, too. Agent Cooper has proven himself a man capable of the most remarkable integrations of polar opposi- tions, and it seems possible, at least, that he will find a way to balance the ferocious ag- gression of BOB with the mystical equipoise he has learned from the Tibetans.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Dream logic, reconsidered</b><br />\n<br />\nEvery dream-related phenomenon in the “Twin Peaks” series has some grounding in current dream research. In that sense, David Lynch has presented a ‘realistic’ vision of dreaming in all its wildly numinous diversity. Certainly if we consider “Twin Peaks” in the context of cross-cultural history and comparative religions, the dream references appear entirely recognizable. In virtually every culture around the world and through history, dreams have been regarded as a primary means of connecting with sacred, transcendent realms, and certain people have the blessing, or curse, of a special ability to travel through dreams to learn esoteric knowledge about those realms, and bring back helpful guidance for their waking communities. Agent Cooper would be a familiar and welcome figure among any indigenous community, from Australia to Africa, from Siberia to the Americas, where shamans have served as cultural dream experts.<br />\n<br />\nEven if our context of evaluation is contemporary western brain-mind science, Lynch’s portrayal of dreaming in “Twin Peaks” strongly resonates with current research. According to multiple studies using a variety of methods, dreaming is fundamentally hyper-associational, perpetually veering between order and chaos, beauty and bizarre- ness, memories of the past and anticipations of the future. Dreaming involves a wide- ranging network of neural systems that are not bound by the strictures of waking consciousness, allowing for the emergence of novel ideas and solutions to problems that have eluded the waking mind. As many researchers from Freud onwards have shown, dreaming is deeply rooted in the instinctual nature of our species and the primal emotions that unconsciously drive our thoughts and actions. Jung and many other clinicians have highlighted conflicts of binary oppositions in dreams as symptomatic of failed psychological integration, while dreams of union and coincidentia oppositorum symbolize growth, healing and the emergence of wholeness.<br />\n<br />\nEvery night we go to sleep, we enter into a truly surrealistic realm of paradox, magic and ambiguity, where we learn, as Agent Cooper has so well, that our waking reality is only made possible by a beautiful yet precarious balance of mysterious, amoral cosmic forces. The dream logic of “Twin Peaks” is the logic of all our dreams.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 13:38:52 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/david-lynch-book_n_4031355.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/david-lynch-book_n_4031355.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 17:38:52 UTC +00:00], ["title", "New Book Explores David Lynch's 'Dream Logic'"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]

She's the author of several books, including <em>Cats on the Couch</em>, and has appeared many times on radio and TV.  Veterinarians consult her frequently.  \"Emotional problems can cause medical problems,\" Carole told me then.  \"That's why you have to treat the <em>total</em> cat.\"  She has a monthly blog, The Wilbourn Way.<br />\n<br />\nMy piece, which was about visits to cats named Byron and Ned, has just been reprinted in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Yorker-Book-Cats/dp/0679644776\" target=\"_hplink\"><em>The Big New Yorker Book of Cats.</em></a>  (Byron was being terrorized by his father, Little Guy; and Ned was mourning the death of a cat named Buster.)<br />\n<br />\nI didn't get many \"Talk\" stories into the magazine, so this was a big moment.  But it always troubled me that Lulu, the third cat Carole and I went to see, never made it into <em>The New Yorker</em>.  And Lulu had the most poignant story of all.  But the legendary Mr. Shawn,<em> New Yorker </em>editor for 36 years, dropped her from the magazine at the last minute -- because (I was later told) he wasn't comfortable with cats in heat or with the possibility that a cat might have been deliberately injured.<br />\n<br />\nSeeing Byron and Ned back in print after all this time started me thinking all over again about poor Lulu, who never got the recognition she deserved.  I dug up my original manuscript, which I guess in her honor I'd always held onto.  So now, finally, here is Lulu, as I wrote about her then:<br />\n<br />\nLulu:  Lulu, a small, sleek black cat with yellow eyes, probably five years old, lives with her person, Mardi, in a studio apartment on Jane Street.  \"I called on Carole to help Lulu overcome some of her fears,\" Mardi said.<br />\n<br />\nLulu is afraid of many things:  unexpected noises, tall men with deep voices, anything that waves over her head, teenagers, anyone in a heavy coat, laughter, closed closet doors, paper, paper bags, and, especially, oven doors.  Mardi's apartment, cheerful and cluttered, is full of plants and has posters of polar bears and gorillas.<br />\n<br />\nCarole began by spending about 15 minutes questioning Mardi, as the two women sat on facing white wicker loveseats.  Lulu was on Mardi's lap, watching her whenever she spoke.  Mardi, a tall, striking woman with large luminous eyes, is a dancer, actress, and a seamstress who designs costumes for Broadway shows.<br />\n<br />\n\"Three years ago on a cold winter afternoon,\" Mardi said softly, stroking Lulu, \"I saw a smoky gray cat, terribly thin, lying on a subway grate to keep warm.  My first thought was 'Poor child!  I hope she doesn't die.'  Both her front legs were broken.  She spent months in a cast and wouldn't even leave my bathroom.  Every day I held her in my arms for hours.  From smoky gray she turned white, and then pepper-and-salt, and only then black.  She's come a long way -- at first she was so terrified of sunlight she wouldn't go near the window.  And so frightened of the TV set, even when it was off, that for a while I had to keep it covered with a cloth.  I gradually realized that she must have been hurt on purpose.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole agreed.  \"Where does she sleep?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"With me,\" Mardi said.  \"I don't mind -- she's not a hog.  Sometimes she cries in her sleep.  I named her after the Lulu in Berg's opera.  They both had such tragic lives.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole got down on the floor and observed Lulu for about ten minutes.  She gave Lulu some catnip, but Lulu wasn't responsive.  She gave Lulu a hand-stitched red toy mouse, which Lulu knocked about.  Then Carole got up and retired to a corner to write up her diagnosis and suggested treatment.  Lulu retreated to Mardi's lap.  In about ten minutes Carole snapped her pocketbook shut, and Lulu threw her arms around Mardi's neck.  Mardi hugged her.<br />\n<br />\n\"Lulu's kittenhood was full of trauma,\" Carole said.  \"She may have had a TV set thrown at her, or been kept in a closet, or even an oven.  I think she is clearly reliving these experiences, over and over.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarole took a deep breath and continued.  \"I don't think Lulu was always the angel she is now.  Far from it.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Lulu?\" Mardi said, her eyes widening.<br />\n<br />\n\"When you found her she was unspayed, which means she was in and out of heat -- probably yowling for days on end, and biting people.  Attack cats are often confined Toms and females who are experiencing constant and intense frustration.  Maybe Lulu was driving her people crazy, and they said, 'If you don't stop it, out the window you go!'\"<br />\n<br />\nMardi held Lulu closer.  \"Were you like that?  Hmm?\"  <br />\n<br />\n\"She has an abandonment complex,\" Carole went on.  \"Get a vet to prescribe anti-anxiety medication, and keep her on it for several months.  That way she won't be so thin-skinned, thinking, Oh!  a closet door!  Oh!  the oven!  Oh!  a teenager in a heavy coat!  Lulu also has the single-cat syndrome.  Another cat would be great -- cats need cat interaction.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"My place is too small,\" Mardi said.<br />\n<br />\n\"Try giving Lulu green olives and melon -- they act as aphrodisiacs.  She's been spayed, so she'll feel sexy but not frustrated.  Massage her.  Compliment her.  Leave soft music on when you're not home.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen we spoke to Mardi a few weeks later, she said she was reluctant to put Lulu on drugs.  \"I'm sure it would help,\" she said, \"but it goes against my grain.  I'll keep on massaging and complimenting her, and I guess at her own pace she'll keep on getting better and better.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat was how my \"Talk of the Town\" piece about Lulu ended.  All these years later, I got an update.  According to a neighbor on Jane Street, Lulu's self-esteem improved beautifully; though still shy, she grew calmer, more self-assured and outgoing.  Mardi got interested in pigeons, and kept a rescue pigeon, which she named Streetdove, in the apartment.  Lulu became friends with Streetdove.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 13:08:10 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lois-metzger/lulu-the-cat-the-new-york_b_3983154.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lois-metzger/lulu-the-cat-the-new-york_b_3983154.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 17:08:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Lulu: The Cat <i>The New Yorker</i> Left Behind"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]

Roach)", :description=>"The Salem witch trials of 1692 may be the best known outbreak of such a panic but they were not typical of the usual neighborhood suspicions.<br />\n<br />\nIn \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Six-Women-Salem-Accused-Accusers/dp/0306821206\" target=\"_hplink\">Six Women of Salem: the Untold Story of the Accused and Their Accusers in the Salem Witch Trials</a>\" (DaCapo Press) I focus on the tragedy through the eyes and minds of six specific individuals, real women with lives before and (for the survivors) after 1692. <br />\n<br />\nThe six are: Rebecca Nurse, Bridget Bishop, Mary English, Ann Putnam Sr., Tituba, and Mary Warren. Of these six, five were accused, three were accusers, two were hanged, one escaped. One was Salem's wealthiest woman and one owned nothing -- not even herself.<br />\n<br />\nWitchcraft, according to the laws and common assumptions of the era, was the cooperation of mortal humans with devils in order to harm others, a spiteful alliance with the forces of Evil rather than an allegiance to God. Neighborhood discord could lead to suspicions about this possibility (which might fester for years), and such suspicions could lead to accusations -- but not necessarily to a conviction.<br />\n<br />\nWhat did it take to be accused of witchcraft in colonial America? What would your odds have been if you had been there?<br />\n<br />\nGranted, the Salem panic  was unusual in the number and diversity of suspects as well as in the duration of the crises. In general, however, an assortment of characteristics could get a person accused of witchcraft, according to the 17th century British sources used by Massachusetts courts in 1692 -- Richard Bernard's \"Guide to Grand Jury Men...in Cases of Witchcraft,\" William Perkins's \"Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft,\" and John Gaule's \"Select Cases of Conscience Touching Witches and Witchcrafts\" -- and more recent studies such as John Demos's 20th century work \"Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England\" (Oxford).<br />\n<br />\nHere are nine of them.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. You are female.</strong> <br />\nAll through western history more women than men have been accused of witchcraft. It took less for a woman to be considered out of line. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. You are middle aged. </strong><br />\nAlthough suspects in 1692 ranged from Mary Bradbury in her 80s to the approximately five-year old Dorothy Good, most supposed \"witches\" were in their late 40s and 50s. Maybe other adults were resentful of a bossy mother-figure, or maybe not. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. You are related to or otherwise associated with a known suspect. </strong><br />\nAs William Perkins pointed out \"witchcraft is an art that may be learned,\" so even if you weren't a middle-aged woman you might be accused if you were friends with a suspected \"witch\" or if the neighbors had had their doubts about your mother, especially in 1692. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. You are of an English Puritan background. </strong><br />\nFor the most part, the accused came from the same majority ethnic group as the accusers. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. You are married but have few or no children. </strong><br />\nNeighbors suffering misfortune might think you were attacking their larger families from jealousy especially if you lacked kin to speak up for you. Unprotected widows were at even more of a risk. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. You are contentious and stubborn with a turbulent reputation. </strong><br />\nWhere a man might be considered forceful, a women might have been labeled as contentious. The situation would be worse if you were also at odds with your own family. After all, the Devil encourages discord. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. You have been accused of other crimes before such as theft or slander. </strong><br />\nAs John Gaule put it a \"lewd and naughty kind of life\" was just the sort of thing that attracted devils. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. You are of a relatively low social position. </strong><br />\nStatus and rank was stronger in the 17th century. Being too often dependent on the neighbors' help could cause them to resent you.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. A confessed \"witch\" accuses you of being a fellow witch. </strong><br />\nThis was a big problem in 1692 when so many suspects \"confessed\" from fear, confusion, or an attempt to curry the court's favor. These confessing accusers generally named people already under suspicion.<br />\n<br />\nThe lesson from all this? <br />\n<br />\nIn 1692 anyone might have been accused of witchcraft. But if you were a widowed middle-aged English Puritan woman with few if any living children and slim financial resources, were known for having a temper and suspected of petty crimes (whether justified or not), and were related to or friends with someone else who was suspected of witchcraft -- watch out for the neighbors.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 12:12:31 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilynne-k-roach/9-reasons-you-might-have-_b_4029745.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilynne-k-roach/9-reasons-you-might-have-_b_4029745.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 16:12:31 UTC +00:00], ["title", "9 Reasons You Might Have Been Suspected of Witchcraft in 1692"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]

Her analysis remains shocking today.<br />\n<br />\nSubsequent research, however, has supported and extended her central thesis.  Arendt was not just right about Eichmann's banality.  She was right about what we now call the Holocaust, and more generally about the psychology of genocide.<br />\n<br />\nAdolf Eichmann was kidnapped in Argentina by Israeli agents in May 1960 and secretly flown to Israel.  There he was put on trial in April 1961, sentenced to death in December 1961, and executed in May 1962 after an unsuccessful appeal.<br />\n<br />\nRecognizing that the trial would be an international sensation, <em>The New Yorker</em> commissioned Arendt to report on it.  Her report, published in 1963 in a series of articles followed by a book, sparked a firestorm of controversy.<br />\n<br />\nEichmann was a bureaucrat assigned by Nazi Germany to address \"the Jewish question.\"  In that capacity, Arendt wrote, he was immediately \"required ... to read Theodor Herzl's <em>Der Judenstaat</em>, the famous Zionist classic, which converted Eichmann promptly and forever to Zionism.\"<br />\n<br />\nAs an expert on Jews in the late 1930s, he testified in Jerusalem, his aim was \"a mutually acceptable, mutually fair solution.\"  What the Jews needed, no less than the Germans, was \"firm soil under their feet so that they would have a place of their own, soil of their own.\"  Working closely with Jewish leaders, he sought potential homelands for a Jewish nation outside Europe.<br />\n<br />\nThus emigration was the first solution to the Jewish question.  The emigration was to be compulsory, making it a process of expulsion, but convincing Jews to go willingly served both Zionist and Nazi purposes.<br />\n<br />\nThe second solution was concentration.  As the war made it less feasible to get Jews out of Europe, they were concentrated instead in ghettos and camps.  Eichmann's job was to get them there. <br />\n<br />\nThe Final Solution was killing.  Beginning in 1942, as it became policy to transport Jews to death camps, Eichmann organized those transports.<br />\n<br />\nAnd here Arendt made her most incendiary observation.  It was not just Eichmann who collaborated with the Nazis, and not just Germans.  And it was not just anti-Semitic people and governments.  Jews also collaborated with the Nazis, and they continued to do so as Nazi policy evolved toward the Final Solution.<br />\n<br />\nIt was popular, she noted, to bemoan the fact that Jews were \"unorganized and leaderless.\"  It was true that \"the Jewish people as a whole ... possessed no territory, no government, and no army.\"  But this was not the whole truth.  \"Wherever Jews lived,\" wrote Arendt, \"there were recognized Jewish leaders, and this leadership, almost without exception, cooperated in one way or another, for one reason or another, with the Nazis\":<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>In Amsterdam as in Warsaw, in Berlin as in Budapest, Jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property, to secure money from the deportees to defray the expenses of their deportation and extermination, to keep track of vacated apartments, [and] to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on trains.</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nJews \"distributed the Yellow Star badges.\"  Jewish Councils (Judenräte) determined who would be sent to death camps, sacrificing some Jews to save others, ultimately failing to save even themselves.  <br />\n<br />\n\"To a Jew,\" Arendt wrote, \"this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story.\"  If only Jews had been less organized, she maintained, fewer would have died.<br />\n<br />\nArendt was scornful of Jewish-specific theories purporting to explain the behavior of the victims as the result of a \"ghetto mentality\" or even a \"death wish.\"  She equally rejected German-specific theories purporting to explain the behavior of the perpetrators as the result of pathological anti-Semitism.  Eichmann was not a monster and showed no evidence of anti-Semitic motivations.<br />\n<br />\n\"The trouble with Eichmann,\" concluded Arendt, \"was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal.\"  Subsequent research shows that her main thesis holds generally for the Holocaust (see especially Christopher Browning's <em>Ordinary Men</em>) and other genocides (\"<a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=edpsychpapers\" target=\"_hplink\">Us and Them: Identity and Genocide</a>\").<br />\n<br />\n\"Those in power,\" said Eichmann in Jerusalem, abused his \"obedience.\"  \"The subject of a good government is lucky, the subject of a bad government is unlucky.  I had no luck.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhat Eichmann illustrated, concluded Arendt, was \"the strange interdependence of thoughtlessness and evil.\"  In his very banality, Eichmann was the prototypical perpetrator of genocide.", :pubDate=>2013-10-02 12:07:13 -0400, :guid=>"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/eichmann-in-jerusalem-50-_b_4026701.html"}], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/eichmann-in-jerusalem-50-_b_4026701.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 16:07:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>: 50 Years Later"], ["updated_at", Wed, 02 Oct 2013 19:35:27 UTC +00:00]]
